            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If <hi>one</hi> Apoſtle had <hi>once</hi> ſayd theſe things, all the World might not, without great ſin, either contradict, or not beleeve. <hi>But in the mouths of two or three witneſſes, every word is eſtabliſhed,</hi> in the judgements of all rational men.

For the Apoſtle doth, as it were, adjure <hi>Timothy</hi> upon this Book, chargeth him upon this, as a ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that Chriſt at his <hi>appearance</hi> ſhal have a <hi>Kingdome:</hi> Not onely that <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Kingly power which hee hath alwayes had with his Church, but he ſhal have a <hi>Kingdome</hi> at his <hi>appearance,</hi> in which he ſhal exerciſe a <hi>judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> over the <hi>bodies</hi> of men, as 'tis alſo expreſſe in this Verſe. How, we ſhal touch by and by. But the Greek hath a farr lowder emphaſis. For it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, THAT SAME <hi>appearance of him, and</hi> THAT SAME <hi>Kingdome of him, or of his.</hi> As <hi>that his appearance</hi> at this time, this Text ſpeaks of, is not meerly <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> but <hi>viſible;</hi> ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, <hi>that his Kingdome</hi> at that time is not onely <hi>ſpirituall</hi> but <hi>viſible.</hi> And further the Greek tels us that Chriſt hath <hi>that Kingdome,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, AFTER, or ACCORDING <hi>to his appearance:</hi> Yea, the copulative AND puts it into that order; namely, firſt his <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> and THEN his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> His <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> at leaſt, is <hi>firſt</hi> in order of <hi>nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> if not in time. Til the Jews be called, none of this Kingdome is ſet up, as is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169801:10"/>the general vote of all the Bible (cleared larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in another Treatiſe.) And how they ſhal be for the generality called at <hi>once,</hi> as (to uſe the Prophets words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.8.) <hi>a Nation borne at once,</hi> without the viſible appearance of Chriſt to them (which they daily expect, oft throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open their windows to behold) let them deviſe that are contrary to us in opinion, for I cannot. The Scriptures tel me twiſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10, 11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.7. (which places cannot be meant of Chriſts comming in the fleſh, or to the ultimate day of the general Judgement, as hath been largely demonſtrated elſe where) I ſay, they tel me that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhal be called by the <hi>viſible appearance of Chriſt. Zecharie</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Jewes Families mourning a part,</hi> and of <hi>pouring out of the spirit upon them,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined at the ultimate day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> quotes the ſame place, carrying it on as a Propheſie of a future time, when Chriſt long ſince had been incarnate, and aſcended. And beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction with meditational men, this Text of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> is cleare for the <hi>appearance of Chriſt</hi> to be the preparation and <hi>Primitie</hi> of his <hi>Kingdome:</hi> At the beginning of which Kingdome, tis ſayd here, <hi>He ſhall judge the quick and the dead</hi> (as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath it.) It can be no danger to keep cloſe to the Original. <hi>I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169801:11"/>charge thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

(weigh the place) And <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4, 5. &amp;c. In the <hi>former</hi> is mentioned <hi>Chriſts Kingdome,</hi> at that reſurrection; and the <hi>anger of Nations;</hi> and reſcuing the <hi>Earth from the deſtroyers thereof:</hi> and the opening of the <hi>Temple, and the Arke ſeen;</hi> which I cannot by any ſafe interpretation make to ſuit with the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate day of the general Judgement. In the <hi>later,</hi> namely, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4, 5. &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter, the ſix times mention of a thouſand years, the mention of <hi>looſing of Satan after that;</hi> the following of the <hi>reſurrection of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169801:11"/>the wicked after that;</hi> the mention of the <hi>Saints reigning mean while with Chriſt a thouſand years</hi> (who <hi>reignes not</hi> after the general Judgement, but layes downe all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.) with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite more that hath beene diſcuſſed on this place, and the other of <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. make me confident, that nothing but the <hi>Corporall reſurrection, and glorious reigning of the Saints on earth for a long time,</hi> can rationally be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in thoſe places. Thus you ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> having Propheſied what evils ſhal be in the <hi>laſt days,</hi> ſhews us clearly what is that which is the period of them, and the beginning of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times: Namely, <hi>Chriſts appearance and his Kingdome:</hi> So that the evils that we are to ſpeake of, according to theſe Texts of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> doe precede, and go next before Chriſts next appearance.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> having foretold the evils of the laſt dayes, doth likewiſe ſet a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous marke upon the times, to ſignifie hee meanes the ſame times as <hi>Paul</hi> did; Namely, <hi>thoſe that foregoe next before Chriſts appearance and Kingdome,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. <hi>That yee may be mindfull of the words which were spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the</hi> HOLY PROPHETS (that is, ſaith <hi>Marlorat,</hi> the words which the Prophets ſpake concerning <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, 2, <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. and of the <hi>laſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169801:12"/>times) Knowing this,</hi> FIRST, <hi>that there ſhall come in the laſt dayes ſcoffers, ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his</hi> COMMING? <hi>For ſince the Fathers fell aſleepe all things continue as they were from the creation:</hi> As if they ſhould ſay, We ſee nothing of Chriſts appearances, but outward providences, or ſpiritual Ordinances, But of Chriſts viſible appearance at his COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MING, we ſee no ſigne or ſymptome: But ſaith <hi>Peter, Verſe</hi> 8. to the Saints, <hi>Be yee not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this one thing, that one day with the Lord is a thouſand years: and a thouſand years as one day:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay (in that hee makes this repetition, according to the judgement, not onely of all the moſt learned <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but alſo of moſt learned <hi>Mede</hi>) that Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wil be ſudden to theſe Scoffers, as if it were but a day or two hence; every thouſand years, and parts of a thouſand years ſhal be but in proportion to a day, and ſo much of a day: The ſeven thouſand years of the World, is but as the ſeventh day of its age, when at fartheſt (if our account of years from the creation be ſo ſhort as we make it, of which we have cauſe to doubt) ſhal be the <hi>Sabbatiſme</hi> of reſt on Earth, as <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs meane, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated largely in our Treatiſe of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years) And that <hi>day a thouſand yeares of refreſhment to the people of God:</hi> And it muſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169801:12"/>be, ſaith <hi>Peter, Verſe</hi> 12, 13. at his <hi>comming,</hi> that for their refreſhment they muſt have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and be in, <hi>New Heavens, and a new Earth,</hi> wherein (though not afore) <hi>ſhall dwell all righteouſneſſe:</hi> And theſe new Heavens and new EARTH muſt be ſuch as he hath <hi>promiſed;</hi> which promiſe is, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 65.17. to the end of the Chapter; wherein this ſtate of the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and new Earth is ſo explained, as cannot (not onely in my judgement, but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt learned <hi>Mede</hi>) be underſtood of ſupernatural glory in the higheſt Heavens. Thus alſo we ſee <hi>Peter</hi> marks out unto us, that the <hi>evill times,</hi> and the <hi>evils</hi> of the times hee ſpeaks of, doe in his ſenſe antecede, and uſher in, the next appearance, or COMMING of Chriſt to ſet up his Kingdome on Earth.</p>
            <p>One word of <hi>Judes</hi> marks upon the times of evil, he ſpeaks of, and then we ſhal lanch forth into the deepe, and Sea of the evils of thoſe times: One marke is, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Enoch the</hi> SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTH <hi>from Adam, propheſied of theſe</hi> (or, <hi>ſuch as theſe) ſaying, Behold the Lord commeth with ten thouſands of his Saints: Enoch</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, according to the computation of <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 5. and of <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 3. was the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> thus; <hi>Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahaleel, Jared, Enoch:</hi> that is, Excluſively, making <hi>Adam</hi> onely the beginning of the All,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169801:13"/>of mankinde, <hi>Enoch</hi> was the ſeventh Father that came out of <hi>Adams loynes;</hi> which is according to the minde of the Text: The ſeventh FROM <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, The ſeventh of the Fathers that were FROM <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> were but ſix Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So between <hi>Adam</hi> and the Age of which <hi>Enoch</hi> Propheſied, <hi>that the Lord ſhould come with ten thouſands of his Saints to judge,</hi> are at moſt but ſix Ages, ſix thouſand yeares; and then the ſtate of things in the ſeventh, <hi>Eòdem recidit, the ſecond Adam</hi> Chriſt, reſtores the World to the perfection of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> but with more ſtability.</p>
            <p>The emphaſis of the <hi>ſeventh from Adam</hi> muſt of neceſſity ſignifie ſome ſuch thing, and not meerly ſignifie the <hi>antiquity</hi> of the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if that had been all, the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the ſtory of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and as an <hi>example</hi> of judgement by <hi>fire,</hi> might alſo have quoted <hi>Lot,</hi> but doth not; of a certainty therefore the <hi>ſeventh from Adam</hi> hath ſome notable thing in it; as all <hi>ſevenths</hi> in the Old Teſtament have. And the conſtant tenor of the Jewes in all ages, <q>is; and hath been, that towards the end of the ſix thouſandth yeare of the World, great will the change be:</q> And our Text tels us that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Enoch</hi> was a <hi>ſeventh,</hi> ſo in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that, the Lord ſhould come to judge,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169801:13"/>now after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, in the <hi>laſt dayes</hi> of the World. Immediatly afore which, <hi>ſhall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly luſts;</hi> ſpoken <hi>long afore, by the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as our Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> tels us, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17, 18. which is a <hi>ſecond marke</hi> of thoſe evil times he ſpeaks of, to be the forerunners of the very laſt times before Chriſts appearance. For if the Apoſtles foretel theſe things long afore, then they are the laſt times, when theſe things ſhal come to paſſe.</p>

But <hi>Principia cognoſcendi,</hi> Principles of knowledge, what as Chriſtians they ought to think and doe, namely, <hi>The knowledge of the Word, to ſome conviction on the conſcience,</hi> that they had. Now from theſe Principles, <hi>immediately afore Chriſts comming,</hi> they were departed: And ſo tis now, in theſe our dayes.

They are moſt <hi>perilous times,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all times afore them, for wicked opinions and practiſes. The wickedeſt times afore, as the Jewes in the worſt of times, held the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both Old and New, though with many falſe gloſſes; but theſe times with open mouth caſt away all the Scriptures, the ground of all divine truth: And what doe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169801:14"/>they walke after or according to then? <hi>Even after their owne luſts:</hi> both <hi>corporall</hi> luſts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe Principles that <hi>pleaſe the fleſh;</hi> and alſo <hi>intellectual</hi> luſts, and mentall wantonneſſes, phantaſies of their owne ſpirits. What ever pleaſant dreames they dreame, or new deviſes they imagine to ſooth up themſelves, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all true feare of God, and the thoughts of <hi>judgement</hi> to come, of <hi>locall Hell</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>immortality of the ſoule;</hi> ſuch dreames and imaginations, I ſay, as theſe that put away all fundamental truths, and the thoughts of them, are their Principles of truth: And like Principles, like concluſions. Upon ſuch premiſes muſt needs follow <hi>damnable hereſies.</hi> That the <q>Creature cannot ſin, becauſe God acts in him: That the Creature hath done nothing that he ſhould torment himſelfe by denying himſelfe any contentment: That all things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and to be enjoyed in common.</q> And thus they <hi>depart from the Faith:</hi> As in that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. of the evil times the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, he ſaith, <hi>Some ſhall depart from the Faith. Eſt fides quâm, &amp; fides qua:</hi> There is either the Faith <hi>which</hi> we beleeve, that is, the <hi>object</hi> and ground of Faith, namely, the Doctrine of Faith, the holy Scriptures; or the Faith <hi>with</hi> which we beleeve, namely, the <hi>quality</hi> of Faith. The parallel of our times to this, is, that there is in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169801:15"/>this Nation, ſuch an apoſtaſie of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, called formerly Profeſſors, from <hi>the Faith</hi> as I never heard or read of in any Eccleſiaſtical Story, of any Nation. <q>We have them that deny the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and with thoſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reproaches caſt upon them, and with ſuch audacious equalizing, yea preferring of their owne dreames above them;</q> as it wil be ſafer to be ſilent touching the particulars, then to carry the ſound of them to your eares: And if they depart from the <hi>object</hi> of Faith, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Word of God; they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatedly depart from the <hi>quality</hi> of ſo much Faith as may be in an Apoſtate before his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away: As, from a <hi>fundament all Faith,</hi> to wit, <hi>That there is a God;</hi> and from an <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Faith, whereby hee once did beleeve that the Scriptures were the truth of God, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes worſe then the <hi>Devill, James</hi> 2. And worſe then the generality of Heathens. * For the <hi>Devill</hi> cannot be an Atheiſt, but his ſinne is properly <hi>the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> maliciouſly to hate and perſecute that truth of which he is fully convinced. And the generality of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could not be <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe of the Common Law of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. whoever of them (as generally they all did) ſet up any thing to be their God, did withal acknowledge ſome Oracle, ſecret conference, or tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:169801:15"/>whereby they knew the minde of that God. And laſtly, theſe Apoſtates are worſe then the <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Papiſts</hi> whom they pretend to deteſt; for they both in all their Hereſies and Errors in opinion and practice, ſtil in the maine keep to thoſe Scriptures they firſt imbraced. Nor is it a ſufficient excuſe for them to pretend they have all things dictated to them by the ſpirit, becauſe we are commanded <hi>to try the spirits by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. And if this place of Scripture is not of weight with theſe <hi>Anti-ſcripturians,</hi> let them heare reaſon. How were they two both ledd by the good Spirit, when at the ſame time the one of them preteu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <q>to <hi>Preach by the Spirit</hi> ſtrange high Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perphyſicall tranſcendencies, and the other in the auditory at the ſame time <hi>breakes out into lowd expreſſions of ſublime spirituall rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> pretended to be upon the parties ſpirit, to the occaſioning of the Preacher to hold his peace a while, til by and by he cryes out to the other, <hi>Be ſilent O fleſh.</hi>
               </q> 
Sure the ſpirit of God is not contrary to it ſelfe, nor the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confuſion: And if there be <hi>a lying spirit,</hi> as wel as a ſpirit of truth, how ſhal we know to diſtinguiſh the <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>lyer,</hi> but by the old good way ever ſince there was a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word on Earth; namely, by the <hi>written Word, Iſa.</hi> 20.8.</p>

               <p>A particular parallell of our times with that in the <hi>1 Tim. 4.1.</hi> that men ſhall give heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>SSould ſeeme that in the laſt times there ſhal be <hi>ſeducing Spirits, and their Doctrines,</hi> as wel as the <hi>Spirit of truth and his Doctrines:</hi> And as <hi>Satan</hi> is called <hi>a lying ſpirit,</hi> ſo hee is ſayd to be <hi>a lying spirit in the mouth of Ahabs foure hundred falſe Prophets,</hi> for one <hi>Michaia</hi> that ſpake by the <hi>spirit of truth;</hi> ſo that <hi>mens spirits</hi> are alſo ſayd to be lying ſpirits; or ſpirits or error, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. prompted, no doubt; alſo by Satan. The Parallell of theſe times to our times in this ſuits thus: Men, yea nominal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: Firſt, are <hi>Levellers,</hi> which was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Doctrine to <hi>Adam.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Familiſts,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men are Deified, and God is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which alſo was in effect the Devils Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Thirdly, are much given to heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Diabolicall Magick and Divinations</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>lawfull Mathematicks, and laudable Art</hi>) to tel, and foretel things which God doth not, and nature cannot declare, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169801:16"/>Predict. I ſpeake not againſt proper lawful Art, which I am ingaged to honour; but againſt ſuch practiſes as are above Art, and belong to Diabolical aſſiſtances; whereby, many in theſe dayes are at laſt decoyed into the Circle of the Devils power of prevailing ſuggeſtions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched <hi>Obſeſſion,</hi> if not alſo moſt probably, by what I could tel you, unto <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi> In <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12. in the type of the laſt times afore Chriſts appearance, tis ſayd, <hi>Now is the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; and the Saints overcome by the blood of the Lamb.</hi> But immediately afore ſhal be a <hi>Woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth, for the Devill is come downe unto you:</hi> I ſay, immediately A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE; becauſe tis ſayd, firſt, <hi>That the Devill and Satan were caſt out:</hi> And then it followes, <hi>Now is ſalvation and the Kingdome of our God, and his Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, tis ſayd, The Devil is come downe, <hi>having great wrath, becauſe hee knoweth he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> * And Maſter <q>
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> ſhewes in his Booke of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> that a man that doth confidently beleeve, that upon ſuch Figures, Circles, and the like Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical traditions, he ſhal be told ſuch and ſuch things, not knowing any divine, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon WHEREFORE it ſhould be ſo, may be in an implicit Covenant with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil..</q> It is not enough for a right knowledge by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169801:17"/>Art, to know, <hi>That</hi> it ſhal be ſo; but to know <hi>juſtly why, and wherefore it ſhall be ſo.</hi> The knowledge of <hi>wherefore</hi> promiſeth Art. But the knowledge of onely THAT it ſhal be ſo, may be ſuſpected of <hi>farr worſe.</hi> And doubtleſſe ſome good men in theſe times, whoſe returne to the truth, witneſſe their goodneſſe (of which we have but rare examples) have been really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched; being forced with an irreſiſtable ſtrange power, to ſay and doe thoſe abſurd, yea and wicked words and things, as I am loath to mention, though I am certaine of them. By their owne confeſſion we may apparantly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil was in it, becauſe of their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and withal ſtrong temptations to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, though the Lord graciouſly kept them from yeelding to them. Theſe things we have partly from their Books, and partly from their confeſſions. To confirme this of the Devils bewitching in a ſort, with ſtrange deluſions, ſome good people by parling with Satan at firſt (as <hi>Eve</hi> did) when he begins to preſent his cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phantaſmes, heare a true and ſtrange Story of <hi>Luther;</hi> 
               <q>who being at prayer, on that the Papiſts cal <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> the Devil repreſents on the Wal, over againſt the fixing of his eyes in his devotion, a moſt exact pourtracture of a Crucifix, limbing forth to the life, Chriſt hanging naked on the Croſſe, with his five
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169801:17"/>paſſion wounds, and drops of blood pendent, and as diſtilling from their Orifices: <hi>Luther</hi> at firſt aſtoniſhed hereat, quickly recovering his ſpirits, did not (as now it would by many, as I perceive by their narrative of what ſights they have ſeen) take it for a revelation, but zealouſly like a prudent ſound Saint, burſt out into words to this effect, <hi>Avant, I defie thee, thou curſed Devill; I know no picture of Chriſt but his Word and Sacraments.</hi> At which words Satan having loſt his deſigne, withdrew his painted Cloth, I meane his repreſented phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie-fopperies. Upon this, a good Woman a while after in <hi>Germanie,</hi> having a ſtrange Viſion (as She imagined) and therein as She conceived, a revelation, diverſe godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and among them <hi>Luther,</hi> were ſent for; when they came, the Woman endeavoured to ſhew them a ſtrange repreſentation upon the Wal, which Shee (as Shee ſayd) ſaw, but they could not. <hi>Luther</hi> importunes the Woman to bid defiance to it, and to ſpit upon the place, in token of her abhorrence; which at laſt, after much importunity, Shee did: Whereupon Shee cryed out, O now it is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Serpent, or great Snake; O now ſaith Shee, it creeps up upon my arme to my ſhoulder; O now, ſaith Shee, it bites me by the eare and ſome drops of blood fell; but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169801:18"/>whether <hi>Luther</hi> ſaw the blood, <hi>Luthers</hi> Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth not expreſly tell me.</q> After which the Woman was quieted. I leave the Reader to make application; whom I could tel other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine relations of apparitions, as was imagined of fire on the Wal, whiles a moſt godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was praying, to comfort another Miniſter, that at that time conceived ſomthing did ſtroke downe the Bedd-clothes upon him as he was in his Bedd. All which artifices the Devil wil uſe in theſe laſt times, to ſee if he can draw away people from the ſure Word of God, to other phantaſtical revelations. Which <hi>Word, Peter</hi> ſaith in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. is <hi>more ſure</hi> to us, <hi>then a voyce from Heaven.</hi> Compare <hi>Gal.</hi> I. <hi>v.</hi> 8. The Devil in the laſt times wil uſe extreame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with all his devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelfe into an Angell of light,</hi> and making HIS MINISTERS ſo to doe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that <hi>he</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>they</hi> may BEWITCH <hi>men from the truth, Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p>So that as there are <hi>ſeducing spirits</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> ſo of <hi>Men,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. of which next, that we may take in all that this expreſſion of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. may comprehend. <hi>Men-ſeducing-ſpirits</hi> are ſuch as pretend much of the ſpirit, either of <hi>Propheſie,</hi> or of <hi>holy illumination</hi> in knowledge (both of them in that 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. &amp; 3.) but by their lips and lives it appeares, they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169801:18"/>to their opinions, or practiſes with a lying ſpirit: So in that 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. And that parallel place of our other Apoſtle under conſideration, <hi>Viz. Jude, Verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Senſuall, not having the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> that is, They make boaſts of having the ſpirit, but indeed are quite contrary to having the ſpirit, for they are <hi>ſenſuall:</hi> They are ſo in their notions, and ſo in their actions; they are not ſpiritualized, but are carnal. So moſt ſadly in theſe dayes: The <hi>Seekers</hi> pretend the ſpirit, but lay aſide thoſe Ordinances that are appointed by the ſpirit, and wherein is heard the voice of the ſpirit, both from God to us, and in us to God. The <hi>Shakers</hi> pretend the ſpirit, but act in a fleſhly manner of quivering, interrupting one another, whiles both pretend to be moved by the ſpirit. The <hi>Familiſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſpirit, yet refuſe a Chriſt come in the fleſh, who was moſt full of the ſpirit, and is the communicator of the ſpirit. The <hi>Ranters</hi> pretend the ſpirit, yet curſe, and ſweare, and Whore, moſt fleſhlily.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>A particular Parallell of our times, to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, Witchcraft,</hi> &amp;c. ſeducing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat I may a little warne this preſent Age of having to doe with the Devil, and his Agents in wayes of <hi>Divinations, Inchantments,</hi> and other Diabolical operations, afore they are aware; let me take this opportunity of our matter and method, leading me hereunto from this Text of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Seducing spirits, and Doctrines of Devils,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To obſerve from <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. that thoſe that act by the Devils aſſiſtance, doe pretend <hi>Art,</hi> yea, and <hi>Book-Art</hi> too, as wel as laudable Mathematicians doe for their commendable Arts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Devil, being a ſpirit of exceeding <hi>knowledge</hi> (for hee loſt onely his goodneſſe) He <hi>underſtanding</hi> better then men the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, the ſecrets of nature, what nature may be heightened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in <hi>being,</hi> or <hi>operation,</hi> and the dependence of actions, both <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>morally,</hi> oft times doth hitt right in Predictions. As hee by his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169801:19"/>Oracle foretold Great <hi>Alexander</hi> of things, as of Victories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> change of Empires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by knowledge he had ſtollen out of the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> 11.3. And ſo by his skil in mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural complexions, and paſſions, and to varniſh incentive objects; obſerving what cauſes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or moral doe uſually produce ſuch effects, <hi>He,</hi> and by his helpe, his <hi>Wizards,</hi> or <hi>Diviners</hi> foretel ſomtimes very right, what wil befal ſuch and ſuch men.</p>
            <p>Then againe, by his exceeding <hi>power and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> he can either change the viſive humour of the <hi>eye,</hi> or the condition of the <hi>ayre;</hi> or he can trouble the inward <hi>phanſie,</hi> making it to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the phantaſmes he preſents, or ſtirr up melancholy, or the like humours, or <hi>patch up a body of the Elements,</hi> he acting in it as the ſoule thereof, or can act in the mouth of a Beaſt, by all which he hath made miſerable men thinke and ſay, they are <hi>Prophets, Chriſt, God</hi> (even as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> by a deep melancholy, and Satan let looſe upon him by Gods permiſſion, thought himſelfe, and ſo acted for many yeares, as <hi>a Beaſt.</hi>) And made an appearance of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſpake in the <hi>Serpent.</hi> Much more can hee doe in man by ſuggeſtion, obſeſſion, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Devil being moſt malicious againſt God, doth in every thing he can, oppoſe God:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169801:20"/>And therefore he alſo being a King or Prince, namely, of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>God of the World,</hi> wil have his <hi>Oracle,</hi> invent his <hi>words and lawes</hi> of the Art of <hi>Divination, &amp;c.</hi> which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to his Subjects, eſpecially to his truſty tryed ones, to put them in execution, to draw others to ſin. And therefore the Apoſtle cals all ſuperſtitious worſhip, Obſervations, actings, and communion with them, <hi>Diabolicall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>The Gentiles ſacrifices are ſacrificed to the Devill: And I would not</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there) <hi>that yee ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils; yee cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils: yee cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, In the laſt times, a little afore the comming of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. The principal wicked Agents of Satan ſhal come <hi>with the</hi> WORKINGS OF SATAN, <hi>with all power, and</hi> SIGNES, <hi>and</hi> LYING WON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS; <hi>and with all</hi> DECEIVE ABLENESSE <hi>of unrighteouſneſſe in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth. And for this cauſe God ſhal ſend them ſtrong</hi> DE LUSIONS <hi>that they ſhall beleeve a</hi> LYE; <hi>that they all might be damned, who beleeve not the truth, but had</hi> PLEASURE <hi>in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The ground of Divination, or Sorcery,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169801:20"/>Inchantment, Witchcraft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a COVENANT. As God makes <hi>a Covenant</hi> with <hi>his people,</hi> ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Sacramental ſeales; by faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they can doe gracious acts, above, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood; as to defie Satan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſin, repel a temptation, and ſuffer great things patiently for the Name of Chriſt: Many Heroick inſtances whereof, and of other things, we have in the eleventh Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and the ten <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> and the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes; ſo the Devil, in deriſion of godlineſſe, and malice to God, and to draw away ſoules from entering into Covenant with God, makes a <hi>Covenant</hi> with wicked men, and ſeales it with many viſible ſignes, figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by confidence wherein, they are helped by him (God permitting) to doe ſtrange things. For which the Scripture is evident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Moſes</hi> having named <hi>Diviners, Obſervers of times</hi> (or as ſome render it, <hi>Aſtrologers</hi>) <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,</hi> and <hi>Witches,</hi> in the 11. <hi>Verſe</hi> he names <hi>Charmers</hi> as the ground worke of all before, and the ayde of them that follow, <hi>Viz. To conſult with a familiar Spirit, and Wizardly to know, and Necromantically to enquire of the dead.</hi> And with ſuch dependence to that which followes doth the Syriack render it: And hee names Charmers with this Notation <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſignifies to be <hi>ſociated, aſſociated, conjoyned;</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Ephraims joyning with Idols, Hoſ.</hi> 4.17.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Tis true, this is but a Simile or Compariſon; but in ſuch is ſuppoſed as granted, an evident truth in the particulars whence the ſimilitude is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; elſe it had not been a familiar and plaine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169801:21"/>way of Preaching, ſo much uſed by Chriſt. So here tis taken for granted, that there are <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> and that Charmers are <hi>skilled in making Compacts.</hi> Not with Beaſts that were a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous imagination; but with thoſe that can helpe them in their <hi>Art,</hi> who onely are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; and ſo they come to have power to Charm, Inchant, and doe ſtrange things, beyond the ſtrength or ſphere of meer Art, or natural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Which Covenant-making with the Devil, doth ſomething more appeare by the Devils of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, fully on his part, which he made to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>That hee would give Chriſt all the Kingdomes, if he would fall downe and worſhip him:</hi> and for that end, formed ſomehow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts ſenſes, a kinde of repreſentation of <hi>all the glory of the World:</hi> Which is ſufficient to ſhew how ready the Devil is to make a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with men, and upon what <hi>tearmes,</hi> and what by permiſſion he <hi>can doe;</hi> and what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities he takes to make ſuch offers; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when men are in the greateſt diſtreſſe (as Chriſt now had faſted forty dayes and forty nights) in which he hopes, men having no help from God, and growing into deſperate diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, his offers may be accepted. For ſurely if he would offer this to Chriſt, who fully would and did refuſe them, how much more to wicked men whoſe lives ſhew that their hearts are badd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169801:22"/>enough to cloſe with his offers. And we have experience to rivet this faſt and firme, from the <hi>confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Sorcerers, Diviners, Witches, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>of very many Ages, who have acknowledged that by vertue of a Covenant with the Devill, they effected what they did.</q> Which to be truly ſpoken by them, common reaſon muſt needs evince, ſeeing the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor,</hi> and the like poore, ignorant, weak, and ſilly, and ſinful men, and women, have no true and right <hi>skill,</hi> nor <hi>divine gift,</hi> nor <hi>power over nature, &amp;c.</hi> above other men, to act their feats; which other men out of Covenant with the Devil cannot act, of what indowments ſoever. Which is the more confirmed, becauſe this I am moſt ſure of, that whiles ſome of theſe Diabolical Artiſts have been at their feats, ſome worthy godly man in the company, ſecretly groaning earneſt prayer to God, that thoſe deluſions of the people might not be permitted, they have ſwet with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to act their wonders, but in vaine, being unable to bring to paſſe; <hi>crying out, that ſome body in the company did hinder them,</hi> Certaine it is, that ſome wicked men have a ſpecial intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Devill: Elſe why ſhould the Apoſtle intimate <hi>Idolaters</hi> have; that <hi>ſacrificing</hi> to the Devil, they have ſpecial <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>partnerſhip</hi> with the Devil.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169801:22"/>that can, the <hi>Greek</hi> alſo (for I cannot ſtand to dilate on all things intending all brevity) and conſider all the circumſtances of that Text, and you wil finde that <hi>Idolaters</hi> are in a great agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Devil; and if <hi>they,</hi> much more <hi>Inchanters,</hi> if ſuch men be not <hi>both.</hi> For <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi> worſhip, and ceremonies, are the <hi>ſeales</hi> of a Diabolical Covenant; and amongſt <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> are moſt <hi>Inchanters, Wiches, &amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi> and formerly in <hi>England</hi> in the Popiſh times; even as the <hi>Heatheniſh Idolaters</hi> had commonly a great intereſt in the Devil, to give them anſwers, predictions, and counſel, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to be ſeen in the <hi>Roman Hiſtories;</hi> and to appeare to them, and doe ſtrange things for them that give to him Heatheniſh idolatrous or Diabolicall worſhipp (the Apoſtle makes them all one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20.) as appeares in the Devils proceedings with the <hi>Indians</hi> and their <hi>Powwowes</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> and elſewhere. And yet further: If theſe <hi>Diviners, Inchanters, &amp;c.</hi> were not in ſome <hi>Covenant</hi> with the Devil, why doth the Scriptures mention them under the notion of THEM THAT HAVE, AND DEALE WITH FAMILIAR SPIRITS, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 18.11. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.3, 7, 9. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.3, 4.

            <p n="6">6. The advantages and opportunities Satan takes to bring men to this, to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him (for that is his Art, to improve his <hi>devices,</hi> upon men taken at an <hi>advantage,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.) I ſay, the opportune advantages, are chiefly two; one when a man is very <hi>high,</hi> another when he is very <hi>low.</hi> Firſt, when <hi>high.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169801:24"/>High with <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-admiration,</hi> affecting novelties, and wonders. This was the Devils fall; and therefore out of much experience, he knowes this to be a fit time to draw away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. By the rule of proportions, If wicked men doe <hi>great wickedneſſes,</hi> when ſwollen with <hi>great pride,</hi> ſelfe-admiration, and affectation of novel wonders: As <hi>Theudas</hi> did, when boaſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>to be ſome body, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 5.36. And <hi>others</hi> did, when durſt ſpeake <hi>great ſwelling words, having mens perſons in admiration, &amp;c. Jude, Verſ.</hi> 16. Then wicked men may doe <hi>greater wickedneſſes,</hi> as to compact with the Devil, to be able to be more wicked, when more ſwollen with greater pride, and <hi>ſelfe-admiration, &amp;c.</hi> Wee have a plaine Text for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.9. <hi>There was a certaine man called Simon, which before time in the ſame City uſed</hi> SORCERY <hi>and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of Samaria,</hi> GIVING OUT <hi>that himſelfe was ſome</hi> GREAT ONE; <hi>to whom they all</hi> GAVE HEED, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saying, THIS MAN IS THE GREAT POVVER OF GOD. In which Text, without my enlarging, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditational Reader may eaſily ſee that to be true that I have aſſerted. What will not men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite prowd ſpirits doe that they may be <hi>admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Simon Magus,</hi> as it follows in this eighth of <hi>Acts</hi> (that is, <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Magician</hi>) firſt gave himſelfe to the <hi>Devil,</hi> that he might be <hi>admired.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:169801:24"/>But when the Apoſtles by their moſt divine, and more wonderfull Doctrine, and Miracles, drew away his admirers to the Faith, then <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> pretended alſo <hi>to beleeve, and alſo would be baptized;</hi> but ſtil having an eye to the <hi>Apoſtolicall new wonders, admiring them,</hi> and (as it follows) hoping to attaine to that power. For ſeeing by the <hi>Apoſtolicall impoſition of hands the holy Ghoſt was communicated to men, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money for that power of communicating the holy Ghoſt to them on whom he ſhould lay his hands.</hi> An evident Character how men firſt bewitched, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, with ſwelling pride and ſelf-admiration, wil become any thing to advance themſelves.</p>
            <p>They wil <hi>pretend</hi> to be on Gods ſide, and they wil be <hi>really</hi> on the Devils ſide, by Compact. This pride and ſelfe-admiration, and wonder-ſeeking in <hi>Simon,</hi> made it evident to <hi>Peter</hi> that he was yet <hi>in the gaull of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity:</hi> We ſee in theſe dayes, that men wil pretend to be Preachers, and wil in publike deliver moſt blaſphemous, and impious things, that pleaſe the fleſh, and promote beaſtial licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, to the end that they may be followed and <hi>admired</hi> of the <hi>multitude, which</hi> generally (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>goe the broad way.</hi> To mee tis cleere by laying all good informations together, that Men and Women come to their height of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169801:25"/>impieties in this method of pride: Firſt, they thinke that a low thing, to waite on Ordinances, which all doe: They muſt be above the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men. Secondly, Next they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they have revelations, and can of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtand ſtrange things (as one of them ſayd ſhee was as wiſe as <hi>Solomon.</hi>) Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They are ſtrangely bewitched, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devill to ſay and doe any thing that may pleaſe the fleſh, and promote their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. They can propheſie future things and <q>not miſſe, as they pretend. They can goe naked, uſe Women in common, and blaſpheme, and drink an health to the Devil (I am ſure I ſpeake the truth) and yet doe not (as they ſay) ſinne in all this.</q> Yea, tis <hi>a conſuming of all fleſh,</hi> as their phraſe is; that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch and diſgrace all that men (as they ſay) put righteouſneſs in, as <hi>fleſhly.</hi> And then fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What is next to all this, but if not in compact with the Devil already, they are in the ready way, For ſome of them doe ſtrange things. But let me add this caution, that Satan ſometimes doth Compact, and concurr with, and aſſiſt men and Women to operate Diabolically under a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner garbe, of ſeeming Art, civiller carriage, and words that ſound of Religion; as by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath been known of ſeveral. Of this more after. The ſecond opportune advantage is <hi>lownes</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169801:25"/>of condition: When Men through croſſes, wrongs, vexations, wants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in deep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; ſo that they ſay in their hearts, what would not they doe, that they might be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch and ſuch. At ſuch times as theſe the Devil by voyce onely, or by ſome ſhape alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth neer to them, offering them ayde; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially upon his conditions. The Devil alſo ſince his fal into his low miſery, knoweth, and that by experience, that this alſo is a faire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to draw men into Compact; as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content makes him deſperately malicious to doe any wickedneſſe, let God be offended never ſo much. By the ſame proportion that <hi>Saul</hi> in his <hi>diſcontent</hi> would conſult with the Devil by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> though before he had <hi>put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe that had familiar spirits, and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards out of the Land;</hi> by the ſame reaſon, men are drawne into league to be Witches and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters. And truely there is not a little towards a <hi>Covenant</hi> with the Devil, to <hi>goe to Witches with confidence,</hi> they can and wil anſwer to their deſires; even * as <hi>Faith in God is the maine of godly mens Covenant with God.</hi> And if (as Maſter <hi>Capell</hi> proves it, in his Book of <hi>Temptations</hi>) it be a kinde of <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the Devil, to be <hi>afrayd</hi> (becauſe of him) <hi>to goe into a dark room</hi> about neceſſary buſineſſe; or to yeeld to turn about the <hi>face in prayer, to ſee if the Devill be behinds,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:169801:26"/>as the phantaſie imagined him to be there; there muſt be much more then a ſubjection, in <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the Devil; or Witches wil and power to helpe. This that I have ſayd about diſcontent is verified by confeſſion of Witches. And by much experience tis evident that <hi>both advantages and opportunities</hi> are moſt improved by Satan, upon perſons moſt <hi>paſſionate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Covenant theſe men may be in, with the Devil, is twofold, according to the manner of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Expreſſe,</hi> to this effect (as hath been confeſſed by many that have ſo Covenanted) <q>The Witch or Sorcerer on his part binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by ſolemne vow <hi>to renounce the true God, and his Word, and his Covenant in baptiſme, and his redemption by Chriſt; and to beleeve in the Devill, and to expect and receive help from the Devill; and in the end of his life to give the Devil his ſoule or body, or both.</hi>
               </q> And to <hi>ſeale</hi> this Covenant, he preſently gives the Devil, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his hand-writing, or ſome dropps of his blood. The Devil on his part promiſeth <hi>to be at this man or womans command, to appeare in any ſhape; to adviſe, to carry him or her any whither, and to doe for them whatſoever they ſhall deſire of him.</hi> You may by the way profitably parallel the preſent times with this; men now <hi>denying</hi> the <hi>true God,</hi> ſaying, the Creature is God, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169801:26"/>God is the Creature; and have not gainſayed, when it hath been objected to them, ſaying, <hi>Then you will make the Devill to be God.</hi> Denying alſo the <hi>Word of God,</hi> blaſpheming it: Renouncing likewiſe all Ordinances, all Baptiſme, holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in their impieties and blaſphemies indeavouring to diſgrace all goodneſſe, they doe interpretatively give themſelves to the Devill. And therefore no wonder that ſome of them can tel, and doe, ſtrange things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A Covenant with the Devil may be onely <hi>implicite;</hi> when men uſe ſuperſtitious formes of <hi>words,</hi> or <hi>Charmes</hi> in way of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or calling for the Devils help in the diſtinct ſtrong thoughts and deſires of the heart to that end; though vocally there be no words of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or plaine bidding the Devil to appeare or doe. Here is on mans part a ful conſent and confidence to worke with the Devil; and on the Devils part he anſwers to their meaning, and ſo witneſſeth the agreement on his part: And mutual conſent, though but manifeſted by ſignes is a Covenant. As if two dumbe, or deafe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould make ſignes of their mutual conſent to marry. 2. When men uſe ſuperſtitious means, with the ſame deſire and confidence of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ayde. As an <hi>Image of a man in Clay</hi> with a Thorne in it, or <hi>an Egg-ſhell in a Paile of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toſſed,</hi> with deſire and confidence, that ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169801:27"/>the Devil ſhal wound ſuch a man, or toſſe ſuch a Ship at Sea; or by ſuch and ſuch Circles, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and Anticks, to deſire earneſtly, and to beleeve confidently that ſuch and ſuch things ſhal be brought to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diabolical Arts, in <hi>generall,</hi> are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>operation</hi> of ſtrange things, or <hi>Declaration</hi> of hidden things. 1. <hi>Operation of ſtrange things,</hi> in <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> is either <hi>Charming,</hi> or <hi>deluding. Inchanting,</hi> or <hi>Charming</hi> (which ſpecifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the ſame) is a working of <hi>ſtrange</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by a <hi>Charme;</hi> as to raiſe Tempeſts, poyſon the Ayre to infection, blaſting of Corne, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men, Women, and Children, killing or miſcheiving of Cattle, or other Creatures. As alſo to allay, or cure the aforeſayd Maladies. What Satan can doe, his inchanting-charming-Agents can doe: Or rather they be but the Puppiets, he is the hand that moves and doth all, behind the painted Cloth of Sorcereris, antick geſtures and feits. Now by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Satan (<hi>Job Chap.</hi> 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great Tempeſts of winde that blew downe the Houſe on <hi>Jobs</hi> Children, cauſed thunder and lightening, or like fiery Meteors (which as <hi>Keckerman,</hi> the Chriſtian Philoſopher ſaith, the Devil doth much abuſe) that burnt <hi>Jobs</hi> Sheep and Shepheards. And finally, ſmote <hi>Job</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all over with moſt noyſome Ulcers. The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169801:27"/>
               <hi>charming</hi> of <hi>Adders</hi> we touched afore, out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. Add <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.11. The <hi>Serpent will bite, without Inchantment;</hi> or <hi>if he be not charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Of <hi>men,</hi> ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no inchantment againſt Jacob.</hi> Should ſeeme that <hi>Balaam</hi> was an <hi>Inchanter;</hi> which more appeares becauſe he was <hi>hired to curſe the Iſraelites that they might be ſmitten, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Numb.</hi> 22.6. &amp;c. But onely God hindered him (as he confeſſeth) otherwiſe it appeares by the fame that went of him, brought to the eares of <hi>Balaak</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> from farr, hee could have done it. <hi>Ibid. Numb.</hi> 22. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. This Inchanting or Charming as a miſchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſinful thing, is forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. There ſhal not be found among you an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, Witch,</hi> or <hi>Charmer</hi> (which are all one in Diabolical <hi>operations.</hi>) Whereby it appeares that neither the thing, nor the meanes are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Charme,</hi> or Spel <hi>expreſſe,</hi> is a <hi>ſentence of words</hi> (which in themſelves are but a <hi>ſound</hi> for <hi>quality,</hi> and a <hi>meaſure</hi> of ſo many ſyllables for <hi>quantity,</hi> and therefore ineffectual in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) uſed by the <hi>Inchanter</hi> or <hi>Charmer,</hi> as a watch-word to the Devil to help him according to his deſire and confidence in him to work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Sometimes this Charme or Spel is plainer, whimpering and muttering ſome ſound of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169801:28"/>or prayer (as in proportion to thoſe now, <hi>Balaam</hi> of old offered <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> when he tryed to have power to Inchant) but uſually imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and unſutable to that they intend. I ſaw one that was ſuſpected, and had been examined for a Witch (and looked likely enough, and at a word of hers, a Boy fel downe, and his limbs ſhrunk up) who as ſhee went along uſed good words: In the particular of plaine Charmes, they uſe alſo that in <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In principio e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat verbum;</hi> and formes of naming the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but ſtil to their owne ſinful end. More uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they uſe and mutter uncoth, and (to us) nonſenſe formes of words. All which are found in the confeſſions and Hiſtories of theſe Artiſts; and ſuch their uſe, by them, whatever the words in themſelves ſignifie, Gramatically, muſt needs be Diabolical. Becauſe they have no ſuch efficacy or uſe by Gods <hi>Ordinance;</hi> they effect no ſuch thing, as <hi>spoken by thoſe that are not in Compact with the Devill;</hi> nor as a <hi>naturall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> doe they Phyſically touch, and work upon the Patient. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, That much of this nature are Amulets, things to hang about the neck againſt Witchcraft; Popiſh exorciſms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring Salt, holy water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a verbal uſe of the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> conſiſting of thoſe letters and ſyllables in that language, to drive away the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or Inchantments; ſo the croſſing of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169801:28"/>body with ones finger to preſerve one from the Devil; the ſcratching of a Witch to diſcover, or cure witchcraft. But they are not <hi>reall</hi> charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Inchantings in them that uſe them ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly through ſimple ignorance, having no Compact expreſly or implicitely with the Devil, with deſire and confidence to act from him; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by theſe they be in a faire way, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Inchanters, is the next doore to Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Charme implicit,</hi> is when theſe Diabolical Artiſts making <hi>Characters, Figures, Images, &amp;c.</hi> with ſeveral <hi>poſtures and geſtures,</hi> ſpeake onely in their hearts their vehement deſires and confidence, that ſo the evil event ſhal be, and tis brought to paſſe. As to make <hi>Circles,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof (as they pretend, but indeed by helpe of the Devil) to doe wonders; or to make the <hi>Image</hi> of Man or Beaſt, in Wax, Clay, Dough, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to bury it in the ground, or in water, or burne it in the fire, thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, deſiring, and beleeving, the death of the thing whereof they made the Image; or hiding the Image where it cannot be found, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as aforeſaid, the utter loſſe of the thing repreſented; or to make impreſſions on ſuch Images with Pins, Thornes, or the like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any part of it, intending likewiſe the torment of the things repreſented, in the ſame
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169801:29"/>parts; and accordingly the ſayd things are done. This is a Diabolical Art, in which ſome Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have been taken in the very act; and is an implicit Charme, becauſe the heart mutters o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, his curſed deſires. Thus of <hi>Charming</hi> or Inchantment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Deluding,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Jugling.</hi> Deluſion is, when the Devill by theſe Artiſts makes one beleeve he ſees that, which indeed he doth not ſee. There are three concurrences to ſight, The <hi>faculty</hi> of the eye, the <hi>object</hi> of the thing, and the ayre, as the <hi>medium.</hi> Now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a powerful, active, and agil ſpirit, can adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, corrupt, alter, or ſophiſticate all theſe very much. All this is made out fully by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, Firſt, that feat of the Witch at <hi>Endor.</hi> Secondly, Satans ſhewing Chriſt at once all the Kingdomes of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thirdly, the word the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. to expreſſe the ſpiritual bewitching of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians.</hi> The Devil could not bring up the body of <hi>Samuel</hi> that holy Prophet, as he could not meddle with <hi>Moſes</hi> body, though <hi>he contended with the Angel about it. Jude, Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>For they that dye in the Lord, doe reſt,</hi> faith <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And the Devil betrayed himſelfe to the godly Readers of that Story, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 19. For, the Devil repreſents one, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſpeaking in the language
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169801:29"/>and godly phraſe of <hi>Samuel, &amp;c.</hi> and yet tels <hi>wicked Saul,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be with him to morrow (in the other World.) We know <hi>Saul</hi> went not to <hi>Samuel</hi> in the other World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our information out of Scripture. In like manner it was impoſſible for Satan to ſhew to Chriſts humane eye, <hi>all the Kingdomes on the round World, and all their glory in one moment, upon one and the ſame Mountaine,</hi> as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.5. Therefore this was but a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſme or fiction of Satans artifice. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Paul</hi> in his compariſon, to ſignifie the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſpiritual bewitching from the truth, uſeth the word belonging to the nature of witchcraft, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, Hath bewitched you by making you to ſee, that which you doe not ſee; as to thinke you ſee that to be truth which is not truth. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, pur for eaſier pronunciation, in ſtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (<hi>Budeus, &amp;c.</hi> So it ſuits with the word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>(Alapid)</hi> which ſignifies to change or turne. So it ſuits more with the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to kil with the eyes. So it ſuits better with our <hi>Latine, Viz. Faſcino,</hi> to bewitch, which (as our <hi>Latiniſts</hi> may ſee) is thence derived. So that lay all theſe together, and it wil be plaine, that the Witch, Jugler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can delude a mans ſight, as if he ſaw reall ſtrange things, by altering the viſive humour of the eye, the courſe of the ayre, and aſpect of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169801:30"/>the object. This <hi>Deluſion</hi> then, is a Diabolical Art of Jugling and deceiving a mans ſight, above the ordinary courſe of nature in <hi>ſhews</hi> of ſtrange wonders done, which <hi>really</hi> and in natural veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not done. Active men of great agility of body may doe ſtrange feats, through hoops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And men of great witt and nimbleneſſe of hand may make beholders admire their <hi>Hocus-pocus.</hi> And true Artiſts, by experiments of Opticks, in angled Glaſſes, by compoundings and dividings, and reflexions, and refractions of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, make wonderful ſhewes. And other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of true nature there are, to make an Egg into any faſhion, onely by diſolving the Shell into ſoftneſſe, by Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to make an Egg-ſhel to fly up: As for natural feats of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works you know or ſee many; but all theſe are ſtil within the ſphere of nature. And men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe they doe not perceive the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe and way of ſuch facts; which true Philoſophers and Artiſts can declare unto them. But the Deluſion we ſpeak of, is above any true natural cauſe, wrought by the help of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, not of God, or of nature. Inſtances of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions</hi> we have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7, 8, and 9. Chapters. Where the Magicians turned <hi>Rods</hi> into <hi>Serpents, Rivers</hi> into <hi>blood, Waters</hi> into <hi>Froggs.</hi> Which could not be really done by them (but onely they made an appearance of ſome ſuch things.)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169801:30"/>Firſt, becauſe the real working of ſuch things is mediate creation (like the making of <hi>Adams</hi> body of Earth.) Now <hi>Creation</hi> is ſo the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worke of Gods Divine power, that wee juſtly in our Creed, according to the Scriptures, make it the peculiar diſtinguiſhing title of God. Therefore onely thoſe that are aſſiſted extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily with the immediate concurrence of God, can doe ſo. As the Prophet in raiſing the dead Childe to life; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in turning Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine; and <hi>Moſes</hi> in doing theſe, and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> other Miracles. But theſe men of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> are called <hi>Magicians,</hi> and their Art <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,</hi> both which are abhorringly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den every where in the Scriptures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did not act by the power of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe in token of Gods defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wicked artifice, <hi>Moſes Serpent ſwallowed up theirs,</hi> as a ſufficient token that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought by the power of God, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermaſtered their devices. Thirdly, Becauſe there are ſuch teſtimonies given to the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes</hi> through the power of God, that they were done really, as are not given to them done by the <hi>Magicians;</hi> namely, That the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> turned into blood, <hi>ſtunk, killed the Fiſh, were ſo loathſome, that the Aegyptians could not drinke of them.</hi> And that the <hi>Froggs</hi> had really life, ſo that when by the power of God, they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169801:31"/>were killed, they putrified, and annoyed all <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> with the evil favour of their putrifaction. Fourthly, Becauſe the Magicians could not doe leſſer things, as to keep off the <hi>Boyles</hi> inflicted upon all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> off of <hi>themſelves;</hi> nor could they make the ſhew of <hi>Lice.</hi> But which is the fifth reaſon, they confeſſed there was <hi>the finger of God in that Miracle:</hi> And by the ſame proportion there was the finger of God in the other Miracles, ſeeing they were greater.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Diabolical <hi>operation of ſtrange things:</hi> Next of the other general; namely, of <hi>Declaration of hidden things,</hi> either <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> called <hi>Divination.</hi> Theſe things the Devil can help his Agents to declare, ſo farr as God permits, partly by his <hi>skill in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the Scriptures;</hi> as before we gave an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his telling <hi>Alexander</hi> future things, out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. partly by his <hi>ſwiftneſſe, as a spirit, quickly to be any where;</hi> and ſo the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of theſe evil ſpirits are at all the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſtate in ſeveral Nations and places, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 4 <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Partly by his <hi>great knowledge above all naturall men, of the Complexions of men, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hearbs, Stones, Beaſts, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> as appeares in part, in the Story of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Swine of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content that owned them; Partly by his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169801:31"/>power (God permitting) to make men and things to doe as he doth predict: For hee can (by Divine permiſſion) <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or <hi>obſeſſe</hi> him without; or ſuggeſt, preſent and inſpire into his phantaſie ſtrange imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Divination by immediate helpe of the Devill.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Devil in this Art of Divination, either maketh the <hi>Witch,</hi> or <hi>Diviner</hi> his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or elſe maketh other things the Diviner, or Witches inſtruments; the Devil ſtil concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Devil makes the Witch or Diviner his immediate inſtrument in Divination, when hee immediately informing the Witches and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, inableth them to tel many hidden things, he ſpeaking <hi>in</hi> them or <hi>by</hi> them. In this reſpect in part, is the <hi>Devill</hi> called a <hi>Familiar spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Diviner</hi> is called, <hi>one that hath a Familiar spirit</hi> ſo frequently in Scripture, as we touched afore; ſhewing there, that the <hi>ground</hi> of this <hi>familiarity</hi> was a Diabolical Covenant; and now we add, that the Devils continuall preſence <hi>in,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:169801:32"/>or <hi>with</hi> the Diviner or Witch to aſſiſt in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the <hi>manner</hi> of the familiarity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> the Diviner, giving anſwers and predictions, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. <hi>A certaine Damoſell poſſeſſed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her Maſter much gaine by ſoothſaying. Sooth is</hi> an old Engliſh word to ſignifie <hi>truth:</hi> as in ſtead of <hi>in good truth,</hi> men were wont to ſay, <hi>In good ſooth.</hi> Marke it, in this Text ſhee is ſaid to have a ſpirit of <hi>Divination;</hi> and it was <hi>in her,</hi> for he <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> her, and that ſpirit gave anſwers <hi>thence,</hi> for ſhee brought her Maſter profit by <hi>Soothſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. that ſpirit is commanded, and accordingly is remanded <hi>out of her.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by its plaine that from <hi>within her he gave the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</hi> Of the manner we ſpake afore, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the name <hi>Obh,</hi> of one that had a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſpirit. Weigh well, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.4. The Devill is <hi>with</hi> the Diviners or Witches, when <hi>he</hi> by <hi>his</hi> wonderful inſpirations, and putting them into ſtrang tranſes and furies, revealeth hidden things to them; as we have Hiſtories of experiences in this kinde: Which tranſes of Diviners are farre different from <hi>divine heavenly extaſies;</hi> namely, <hi>both,</hi> becauſe <hi>thoſe</hi> deprive the <hi>Witches</hi> of their reaſon for that time, mixing a kinde of madneſſe and frenzie with their imaginations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.7. <hi>theſe,</hi> on the other ſide, preſerve the reaſon of Saints, and ſpeak diſtinctly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169801:32"/>to reaſon. As <hi>alſo</hi> thoſe in Witches may utter ſome peices of truth, yet doe tend to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it, or draw men to doubt of it. But <hi>theſe</hi> in the <hi>Saints</hi> are altogether for manifeſtation, and confirmation of the truth. We read in the Scriptures, and in Hiſtories, what madd fits the Diviners had, crying out, and clamouring like frenzie men. And though the Devill in them confeſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> (<hi>Mark</hi> 1.24.) yet with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice caſt upon him that he was of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which was in <hi>Galilee, Matth.</hi> 2.22, 23. which names of <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> were both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical to the Jewes receiving <hi>Chriſt;</hi> becauſe it was propheſied he ſhould come out of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> which though he did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1. Yet this the Devill in his poſſeſſed would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but proclaimed him to be of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and this took with the people generally (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe he had dwelt there a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of perſecution.) See <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.10, 11. <hi>And when hee came to Jeruſalem, all the City was moved, ſaying, Who is this? And the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſayd, This is Jeſus the Prophet of</hi> NAZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RETH <hi>of</hi> GALILEE. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.71. They accuſe <hi>Peter,</hi> one ſaying, <hi>This fellow alſo was with Jeſus of</hi> NAZARETH. And then another ſaying, <hi>Thou alſo waſt with Jeſus of</hi> GALILEE. And this made them that were good men that knew not ſo perfectly his birth at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169801:33"/>his living at <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> to wonder at a good Prophets ariſing out of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> So good <hi>Nathanael, John</hi> 1.46. <hi>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth.</hi> But the unbeleevers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account refuſe him; and endeavour to keep <hi>Nicodemus</hi> off, <hi>John</hi> 7.52. <hi>Search and looke, for out of</hi> GALILEE <hi>ariſeth no Prophet.</hi> This is juſt like thoſe furies that are in the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of this preſent Age, they pretend to Preach and ſpeak ſome good things; but mix many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable blaſphemies, to the diſhonour of God and Religion. But divine extaſies in good men are wholy for the revelation and confirmation of the truth. See in that of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. And that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. By the <hi>firſt</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and confirmed the <hi>call of the Gentiles:</hi> By the ſecond, the <hi>call of the Apoſtle,</hi> the knowledge of the <hi>excellency of Chriſt,</hi> and the glory of <hi>locall Heaven,</hi> which are things now doubted of by this preſent Age.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how in Divination, the Devill makes Diviners, or Witches his <hi>immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> he ſpeaking <hi>in</hi> them or <hi>to</hi> them, to informe their Clients.</p>
            <p>Next followes, how in Divination, the Devill makes other things the inſtruments of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners, or Witches, whereby to make knowne his minde to them for predictions to others, that ſeek to them for that purpoſe; and theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169801:33"/>with the art of uſing, are as really the <hi>doctrines of Devils</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) as any of all that hath been ſayd touching Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, Inchantment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all as truely the <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> as Doctrines of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>impiety,</hi> if not more immediately of the Devill, then Hereſies and Impieties, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded partly of the wicked reaſon and luſts in men, and partly of the Devils ſuggeſtions.</p>

            <p>The ſinful ſuperſtition, and diabolical art uſed in theſe three kinds of divination, (that we here put together in this chapter, becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable intermingling of them in ſeveral circumſtances and appendices) is in briefe this:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Augure,</hi> or <hi>Augurer,</hi> or hee that uſeth <hi>Auſpicie,</hi> ſate on ſome kinde of Tower, the ayre being clear without dark Clouds or raine, with his <hi>Lituus,</hi> a crooked Staffe in his hand, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Laena,</hi> a robe adorned with Scarlet and Crimſon guards; his head covered, his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt; in which poſture, he quartered out with his Staffe, the Heavens into certaine Temples, Regions, or diviſions, obſerving in which of them the Birds did appeare: If they came towards his left hand, then that was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of good luck, becauſe it ſhewed that they came from their Heatheniſh God his right hand. For the givers right hand is towards the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers left hand. From this ſuperſtitious divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſprang thoſe phraſes among the Latines and Greeks, <hi>Auſpicari rem,</hi> to begin a matter (with <hi>auſpicie</hi>) to doe a thing, <hi>Bonis avibus,</hi> with lucky Birds, or <hi>Bonis auſpicijs,</hi> with lucky auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

               <hi>Pronunciare,</hi> or <hi>Obnunciare,</hi> pronounce it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or renounce it as unlawfull: And from this twofold augurating with, and without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, were ſignes diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Oblative,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Augure, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without prayer: and <hi>Impetrativa,</hi> obtained by prayer. And the good ſignes were called <hi>Proſpera,</hi> and the badd <hi>Adverſa.</hi> Add further, that the Augure that did pronounce, or renounce any thing ratifiedly, did firſt ſee more then one onely ſigne, the one following the other, before he undertooke to give a peremptory judgement; and therefore did not onely obſerve the <hi>flying,</hi> or <hi>crying</hi> of Birds, but ſecondly <hi>Thunder,</hi> which if on the left hand of the Augure, <hi>Tonitruſve ſiniſtri</hi> (<hi>Ovid. Triſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Eleg.</hi> 8.) and <hi>Intonuit lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> it ſignified (as they ſpeake) good luck. Thirdly, The manner of Chickens, eating crums caſt to them (of which by and by.) Fourthly, Beaſts croſſing the way, or appearing in ſome unwonted place. Fifthly, Some ſuppoſed voice, they know not whence (as <hi>Caedmus</hi> thought he heard ſuch a voyce when he killed the Serpent, <hi>Vox ſubitò audita eſt neque erat cognoſcere promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum unde, ſed audita eſt, Ovid. Met. l.</hi> 3. <hi>Fab.</hi> 1.) Sixthly, Caſualties, whether (as they had their rules of interpretation from the Devil) they were <hi>Bona omina,</hi> of a good ſignification, or <hi>Dira, i. e. Dei ira,</hi> ſuch as ſignified the anger
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169801:37"/>of their Gods; as the falling of Salt towards them at the Table, or the ſpilling of Wine on their clothes.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Pullarie,</hi> you ſee it involved in, and chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Augurie</hi> and <hi>Auſpicie;</hi> not onely by our <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their ſuperſtitions, but alſo by thoſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> afore quoted, as the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> expound them, that beſt know their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; therefore of this kinde of Divination briefly.</p>
            <p>The manner was this, that if in a morning the <hi>Bird-Prophet</hi> caſt crums to Chicken in a Pen, the doore of it being opened with ſilence, and the Chicken made no haſte to their meat, or walked by it, or came not at all to it, then it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Gods did not approve of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; but if the Chicken came haſtily out, and eate ſo greedily, that ſome of the meat fell out of their mouths, this ſignified the Gods approving of the enterprize. And thus the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius,</hi> the Bird-Prophet did divine by Pullens greedy eating of crums, to a letting ſome fall, and rebound againſt the ground; whence the Divination was called <hi>Tripudium;</hi> that is, a rebounding on the ground. This <hi>Pullarie,</hi> tis thought came from the <hi>Lycians,</hi> who when they would know the minde of their Gods in any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, went to the Fountaine dedicated to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> into which, caſting their baites, if the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169801:37"/>Fiſhes did eate them, they underſtood it a ſigne of good luck; if not, then of ill luck, <hi>Alex. Gen. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>For a parallel of theſe times with theſe kinds of Obſervations and practices; tis eaſily made, as to the ſubſtance, though not in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For <hi>Birds,</hi> tis common in theſe dayes for people to make theſe obſervations; That by chattering of <hi>Magpies,</hi> they know they ſhall have ſtrangers; by the flying and crying of <hi>Ravens</hi> over their houſes, eſpecially in the dusk evening, and where one is ſick, they conclude death: The ſame they conclude by the much crying of <hi>Owles</hi> in the night, neer their houſes at ſuch a time. The ſame they conclude of a <hi>Cricket</hi> crying in an houſe where was wont to be none. There is (and I think it is in the Book of Martyrs) a Story of a perſecutor, over whom a Raven or Crow flying over his head, and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his head, did ſo much regard it as an evill ſigne, that he fell into ſuch a vehement diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, that he went home curſing the Crow, and dyed: And as a juſt judgement on them that regard ſuch ſuperſtitious things as theſe, the Devill hath manifeſted his preſence with ſome, to the making of them Witches, by an Hen and Chickens, and to others, as a Crow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For <hi>Beaſts,</hi> their obſervations are,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169801:38"/>If <hi>Doggs</hi> houle in the night neer an houſe where ſome body is ſick, tis a ſigne of death. If an <hi>Hare</hi> or the like creature croſſe the way where one is going, it is (they ſay) a ſigne of very ill luck. In ſo much as ſome in company with a Woman great with Childe, have upon the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch creatures, cut or torne ſome of the clothes off that Woman with Childe to prevent (as they imagined) the ill luck that might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal her. I know I tell you that which is moſt true: And I hope in ſuch a ſubject as this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſuperſtitions, I ſhall not offend in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you with theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For contingencies of <hi>things,</hi> how common is it for people to account it a ſigne of ill luck to have the <hi>Salt-ſeller to be overturned, the Salt falling towards them:</hi> And as common, to look upon any thing almoſt comming to paſſe that is not uſuall, to be a ſigne that ſuch an act was wel or ill done (as people pleaſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it) which was done a little afore the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that ſigne: So how common is it to ſay a Winter thunder is an ill ſigne: And how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is it with people (eſpecially of the more ignorant ſort, which makes the things more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) to think and ſay (as Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> relates) if they finde ſome peices of <hi>Iron,</hi> it is a prediction of good luck to the finders. If they finde a peice of <hi>Silver,</hi> it is a fore-token of ill
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169801:38"/>luck to them. If their <hi>eares tingle,</hi> they ſay it is a ſigne they have ſome enemies abroad, that doe, or are about to ſpeake evill of them: So if their right eye itcheth, it betokens ſorrowfull weeping; if the left eye itcheth, then it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens joyfull laughter: And ſo from the itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the noſe, and elbow, and ſeverall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings of ſeverall parts, they make ſeverall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, too ſilly to be mentioned, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by them.</p>
            <p>I am ſure theſe kinde of men and Women have as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Itching eares; giving heed to Doctrines and rudiments,</hi> that are not of God. And ſo ſuch doctrines, ſuch lives.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For <hi>voyces,</hi> theſe alſo are much hearkened after, and heeded and regarded, in theſe evill times of ſpirituall doteages. I ſpeake what I know, of pretended high Profeſſors. They teach one another to goe downe to the lower end of the Orchard, or the like ſolitary place, there to heare a voyce that ſhall be ſpoken to them; and they doe hearken for voyces: And moſt likely that they that doe attend for ſuch voyces, may hear them; even from the Devill; for we ſhewed afore, how the Devill doth not onely ſpeake by Men and Women, but to Men and Women. I ſay, voyces from the Devil not from God; becauſe the word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. and every where commands
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169801:39"/>us to hearken to the voyce of the written Word. And to turne away from the certaine word, to uncertaine voyces, what and whence they are, muſt needs be from the Devil. As Papiſts giving a Stone, or Woodden Croſſe the right hand as they goe or ride by, ſome alſo putting off their Hats, in ſo doing are guided by Diabolicall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; that Croſſe being not appointed a <hi>Medium cultus.</hi> (Compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 7.) So theſe pretended Proteſtants that doe (as I may ſay in a Figure) give the right hand to voyces, I know not what nor whence, leaving the <hi>Word of God</hi> as a ſurer and more effectuall divine inſtituted meanes of ſalvation, then <hi>a voyce from Heaven</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.10.) doe herein follow Diabolicall lyes.</p>
            <p>For it is a maine artifice of the Devil, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall fine pretences, and degrees, to bring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple off from the Word of God. And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, theſe polluted times doe interpret. Being got looſe from the divine rule of the Word that did tye their conſciences (moſt righteouſly and holily, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.) from impieties, they breake out into Whoredomes and blaſphemies; the firſt to pleaſe the filthy fleſh; and the ſecond to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie conſcience, that they might never awake more unto repentance.</p>
            <p>But in the behalfe of theſe Diabolicall and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169801:39"/>ſuperſtitious Divinations and Predictions, ſome things are objected by the favourers of them.</p>
            <p>As firſt, That they have been moſt anciently obſerved and heeded by men of ſtrong natural abilities, as appeares by <hi>Cicero in his Tracts of Divination:</hi> and the <hi>Roman Hiſtorians, and Poets;</hi> and diverſe <hi>Greek Antiquities,</hi> of all which we have had ſome touches afore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw,</hi> The Devil that old Deceiver (ſaith the Scripture) was from the beginning, and the Devil was a deceiver from the beginning, even from our firſt Parents downeward: And from that, the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) warnes the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to take heed of <hi>Him.</hi> And thoſe that moſt anciently learned theſe Doctrines and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the Devil, were Heathens, that had not the Word of God; which we have heard, is flatly againſt them, which muſt fully ſatisfie Chriſtians: and it will be their greater ſin, that having the rule, forſake the rule, and tranſgreſſe againſt the rule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They object that it is ſayd, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 5, 15, <hi>Joſeph</hi> could <hi>Divine by his Cup.</hi> And it is ſayd by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.54, 55. <hi>When you ſee a Cloude riſing out of the Weſt, ſtraightway yee ſay there commeth a ſhowre, and ſo it is. And when yee ſee the South winde blow, there will be heat, and it commeth to paſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, To that of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Firſt, That
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169801:40"/>that might be ſpoken according to the common opinion of the people, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> could divine in ſuch a way (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>Loquendum eſt ut vulgus, ſentiendum ut ſapientes:</hi> We muſt ſpeake as the common people, but thinke as wiſe men.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, This kinde of language might be uſed of purpoſe onely to conceale <hi>Joſeph</hi> from being thought by his Brethren to be any other then an <hi>Aegiptian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That by the <hi>taking away</hi> of the Cup (often uſed) not by the <hi>Cup it ſelfe, Joſeph</hi> would finde out (miſſing it) as by a plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, what manner of perſons they were with whom it ſhould be ſound, by them to be taken away.</p>
            <p>And in particular, by this ſeeming guilt and ſuſpition of his Brethren, he ſhould have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſtay his Brethren (to have further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them) and to try their affections to his Brother by Father and Mother, namely <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in whoſe Sack the Cup was found.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the words of Chriſt wee ſay, that from naturall neceſſary cauſes, to naturall events, we learne by experience a certaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prediction: As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The North winde driveth away raine, Prov.</hi> 25.23. And we uſually finde, that the South winde brings raine to us: And wee know when Birds waſh
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169801:40"/>themſelves it is likely to raine, with many the like inſtances. But by naturall, or artificial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, to foretell caſuall, and arbitrary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and things moſtly depending upon the ſpontaneous will of man, is not poſſible, but by Diabolical aſſiſtance. Of the former ſort of cauſes, and their events; namely, of the natural, true natural reaſons may be given; but of the latter, namely, the arbitrary and caſuall, no juſt reaſon can be given.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To both, namely, that of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we anſwer, That whatſoever things doe truely predict events, muſt ſo predict, either by a gift of <hi>Creation,</hi> ſtamping into them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; as the comming of <hi>Swallowes,</hi> and other ſleeping Birds ſhew Summer is come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe by divine Ordinance of God by poſitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as the <hi>Roinbow</hi> ſignifies the World ſhall not be drowned, although the Raine be never ſo great. But the <hi>flying and crying of Birds,</hi> or <hi>Joſephs Cup,</hi> or any other of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, have no faculty by either of thoſe ways we now mentioned, to predict; and therefore conjectures by them are taught by the Devil.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> But accordingly things doe come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes they doe, as a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to ſuffer them to be deluded, who contrary to the Word give heed and credit to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169801:41"/>them. And ſometimes they doe not come to paſſe, and eſpecially not to them that according to the Word, doe deſpiſe them; that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to them that will ſee, that God overrules all, Devil and all.</p>
            <p>I knew a young man diverſe yeares ſince, that ſayd going over ſuch a ſtyle, he thought hee heard a voyce ſaying to him, In ſuch a yeare of the Lord thou ſhalt dye, and he related it as a very ſerious thing: But (that I may ſpeake a little to voyces alſo) it came not to paſſe. The Devil and his phantaſie were deceived. And though the dreaming Fantaſticks of theſe times, forme in their braines an hearing of voyces, as ſome divine <hi>revelation,</hi> they are herein deceived, becauſe Revelations were given to them that ſtuck mightily to the Word of God, and were holy in practice; and to the end (as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations did expreſſe) to inlarge and unfold the minde of God in his Word, and to promote holineſſe of converſation, and put men on to walke in that way.

            <p>THESE two we have put together, becauſe joyned together in Scripture, and ſometimes in uſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.21, 22. <hi>The King of Babylon ſtood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes to uſe divination; he made his Arrows</hi> BRIGHT (Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

And that the King of

               <hi>Babylon</hi> being to goe to Warr did by <hi>Aruſpicie,</hi> and <hi>Sortilegie</hi> divine whether he ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Rabbath</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> to Warr; or againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of the <hi>Jewes, Verſ.</hi> 20.)

For the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatious World hath alſo uſed (as R. <hi>David,</hi> R. <hi>Solomon, Vatablus, Alapide, &amp;c.</hi> tell us) this divination; namely that they call <hi>Catoptroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke;</hi> that is, Divination by <hi>Looking-glaſſes,</hi> or <hi>Mirrors,</hi> after this manner; the Diviners in the glittering and ſhining of the points of Speares, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in the ſhining of the Nayle of the Thumb, or in ſome Chryſtall, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did (by rules learned from the Devill) ſee things paſt, or foreſee what ſhould come to paſſe.</p>

Hieron,</hi> his ancient Latine Tranſlation reads it, <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens ſagittas,</hi> mingling Arrowes together. By all that we have ſayd, this in the general doth plainely appeare, that anciently there was a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious art of Divination by Darts, Rods, or Arrowes, for which the Greeks have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fit name; calling it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Dart,</hi> or <hi>Arrow-Magick;</hi> or <hi>Staffe,</hi> or <hi>Rod-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> or <hi>Divination.</hi> And not only in uſe among the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as appeares in this Text of <hi>Ezek:</hi> 21.21. but was ſinfully imitated by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as <hi>Hieron, Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> conclude from that of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.12. <hi>My people aske counſell at their ſtocks</hi> (Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in, or by their wood) and their ſtaffe declareth unto them.</hi> The word
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169801:43"/>for Staffe both in the Hebrew and Greek ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies both a <hi>Staffe</hi> and <hi>Rodd,</hi> or <hi>Wande,</hi> or <hi>Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is plaine in the generall, that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did divine by Arrows, Darts, Staves, Rods; and the Word of God condemnesit, as an Heatheniſh invention, and ſinfully imitated by the Jewes.</p>
            <p>In particular, the manner was two wayes (as we have intimated it a little in the various ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By <hi>mingling of Arrows,</hi> after the ſeveral names were written upon them of the things concerning which the Lottery was to be made; putting thoſe Arrowes up againe promiſcuouſly into the Quiver, one blindfolded drawes one, and as it is written on the Arrow, ſo is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination concluded. For inſtance, The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this 21. of <hi>Ezek. Verſ.</hi> 21. would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine whether hee ſhould goe to Warre againſt <hi>Kabbath</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> or againſt <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Theſe two names are written upon two Arrowes, which put up, and drawne againe, in manner aforeſayd, the firſt that came, determined whither hee ſhould goe to Warre. And ſhould ſeeme by the intent of this 21. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> God willing to puniſh <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he permitted that their Lott ſhould fall upon it. So <hi>Hieron.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:169801:43"/>
            <p>Secondly, By Staves, Rods, Darts, Arrowes, <hi>throwne, darted, or ſhot up into the Ayre;</hi> and whitherward they tended in their returne and fall, thither the divination (as they conceived) directed them. Of this, <hi>&amp;c. Chald, Polichron. Caelius Rhodoginus. l.</hi> 7. <hi>Antiq. lect.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>And this is the moſt likelyeſt way of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> uſed at this time, in this 21. of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> That balancing two or three Arrowes bolt upright (as we ſay) or ſhooting them upright into the Ayre, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they fell, as, if they fell (in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne) towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was a certaine judgement by Divination, that he was to make his expedition againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Rabbi Joſeph Kimchi, fecit ſagittas, ac</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>volare fecit in aere, ut videret in quam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem caderent; Et ſi caderent ad latus filiorum Hammon, iret illuc; ſin ad latus filiorum, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And ſo the Chaldee Targum afore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp;c. Hee ſhot out of a Bow his Arrowes, &amp;c.</hi> And reaſon tels us that to this ſuperſtition the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> would rather incline, at this time (as <hi>Alap.</hi> conceives.) He would not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by Books, or other meanes, but by <hi>Arrows,</hi> with which he was to fight the Battell hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And his <hi>ſhooting of them up to Heaven was</hi> a faire ſemblance of asking counſel of God. As <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> expounds <hi>Abaris</hi> the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169801:44"/>
               <hi>Scythian</hi> his ſhooting of an Arrow from ſome part of <hi>Greece</hi> into part of <hi>Scythia,</hi> to ſignifie a minde contemplating his eternall Countrey in Heaven.</p>
            <p>All this while we have conſidered but the firſt clauſe of this 21. of <hi>Ezekiel, Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Viz.</hi> the meaning of the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> uſe of Arrowes in Divination, in a way of <hi>Lottery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, tis ſayd, he <hi>Conſulted with Images, or Idols,</hi> that is, with <hi>Bel, Nebo,</hi> and other his Idols.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee <hi>looked into the Liver:</hi> Here is his <hi>Aruſpicie,</hi> or <hi>Extiſpicie,</hi> looking into the <hi>Exta,</hi> the <hi>entrals</hi> of Beaſts, killed in Sacrifice, after their Heatheniſh manner. Properly the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>lungs</hi> were called <hi>Exta ab Extando,</hi> becauſe they are placed in the upper part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man; as alſo the <hi>Spleen,</hi> the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the <hi>Stomack,</hi> were called <hi>Exta,</hi> becauſe they were placed above the reſt of the Bowells and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>The Heathens did divine by conſidering in the Sacrifice the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It followes in this 21. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> At <hi>the right hand was the Divination for Jeruſalem</hi> (Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. <hi>In, or at his right hand was the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Jeruſalem) to appoint Captaines to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the mouth in the ſlaughter:</hi> that is, By his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169801:44"/>
               <hi>Auſpicie, Imagery,</hi> and <hi>Lotterie,</hi> he concluded a certaine divination that hee muſt goe againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there <hi>open his mouth,</hi> exhorting his Captaines and Souldiers <hi>to open the mouth of the Sword</hi> (as the Scripture phraſe is, the <hi>mouth of the Sword,</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>edge</hi> of the Sword) to deſtroy the Jewes.</p>
            <p>Having heard the Scriptures concerning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſpicie</hi> and <hi>Sortilegie,</hi> that we may the better underſtand the ſinful manifold ſuperſtitions of them, let us heare what Hiſtories, Antiquities, and Cuſtomes can produce concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful manner and uſages of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of <hi>Aruſpicie,</hi> or <hi>Extiſpicie,</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in breife was this. The Soothſayer obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome things before he killed the Beaſt; ſome things in the entrals of him being killed; ſome things after, when to be offered up by fire. Firſt, Before his killing the Beaſt, whether the Beaſt came willingly without drawing, whether hee received the ſtroke without bellowing, and whether he dyed without ſtruggling, and with one blow onely, all which were good ſignes: And whether no unlucky ſignes were ſeene or heard whiles they were ſacrificing. Secondly, When the Beaſt was ript up, he obſerved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bowels were not of an unnatural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or were not Exſiccat, impoſtumated, or ulcerous, which were ill ſignes: He divided the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169801:45"/>Bowels into two parts, the one was called <hi>Pars familiaris,</hi> from which the Diviner foretold what ſhould befal their owne party; the other was called <hi>Pars hoſtilis,</hi> from whence hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told what ſhould befall their Enemies. Thirdly, After, when the Sacrifice was to be burned, it was diligently obſerved, whether the flame of the fire was ſmoakey, whether the ſmoak rolled and tumbled in the ayre, whether of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuence or no: For all theſe were unlucky ſignes, as the contrary lucky (as they ſpake.) Thoſe that obſerved theſe tokens of the ſmoake had a peculiar name, <hi>Capnomantes,</hi> that is, <hi>Smoak-diviners.</hi> All this ſuperſtition came to the <hi>Romans</hi> (as the ſtory goes) from the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſci:</hi> They had it from a young youth called <hi>Tages,</hi> and he from the Devil. Of theſe things many touches in <hi>Senec. Trag.</hi> and <hi>Ovid. Metam.</hi> And more in <hi>Cic. de divinat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For <hi>Sortilegie,</hi> Divination by Lots. A Lottery, or deciding by Lot in the general is thus deſcribed.</p>
            <p>A caſual event purpoſely applyed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyding of ſome doubt: The <hi>genus,</hi> or <hi>generall</hi> in this deſcription is, <hi>ſome caſuall event.</hi> And therefore <hi>Aquinas, &amp;c.</hi> ſpeak too widely, when they ſay it is, <hi>Cum aliquid fit,</hi> or <hi>aliquid agitur ex cujus eventu conſiderato, aliquid occultum innoteſcat:</hi> A doing of <hi>any thing,</hi> or any thing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169801:45"/>is done by which, being conſidered, a hidden thing may be diſcovered. For a man may leave Money up and downe in the Houſe, to try a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Servant, and thereby diſcovers the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, or diſhoneſty of ſuch a one; yet this is no Lot.</p>
            <p>The <hi>specificall difference</hi> to make caſuall events to be <hi>Lots,</hi> is taken from the <hi>intent and uſe of a man,</hi> applying caſual events according to <hi>his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall,</hi> to that <hi>purpoſe of deciding and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome doubt; Viz.</hi> Either ſome doubtfull act to be done, as yet in ſuſpence; or ſome hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den truth to be diſcovered in things already done, or ſuſpected to be done. And therefore for a man to meet ſome notable perſon or thing unexpectedly in the way, intending other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a thouſand ſuch caſualties incident to a man all his life long, is no Lottery or Lott at all.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe ſome Lottery, or caſting of a Lot is lawful; therefore to diſtinguiſh the bad we are to ſpeake of, from the good; were muſt diſtinguiſh of the <hi>kinds</hi> of Lotts, and that from the <hi>Originall</hi> of them, which is more proper to the caſe of conſcience in hand, what Lotts are lawfull, and what unlawful. According to the <hi>Originall,</hi> there are three ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such as are <hi>Divine;</hi> namely, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript from the Word of God.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:169801:46"/>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Vaine</hi> ſporting and fooliſh, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the idle braines of men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Diabolicall</hi> for Divinations, hatcht by the traditions of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt ſort the Scripture makes mention of the allowable uſe of theſe ſorts of Lots.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of Lots in <hi>ſacred</hi> things that cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be well determined: As to diſtinguiſh which of the two Goates ſhould be the <hi>ſcape Goat,</hi> the other to be ſacrificed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.8. And the Brethren chooſing two, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a Lot, which of them ſhould be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> in the room of <hi>Judas, Acts.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of Lots in <hi>morall</hi> things; as to finde out by Lot who is guilty in a multitude, of ſome eminent tranſgreſſion, that hath cauſed a great affliction on the reſt: As in finding out <hi>Achan, Joſhua</hi> 7. <hi>Jonah, Chap.</hi> 1. And the Lord did ſo approve of Lots in this kinde, that hee was with them in caſting Lots, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. to finde out who had eaten of the Honey contrary to <hi>Sauls</hi> adjuration; though it appeares by the event, that Gods intent was rather to ſhew <hi>Saul</hi> his ſin in his raſh adjuration, then to ſhew <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> his ſin in eating of the Honey, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Fathers Oath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Of Lots in <hi>politicall</hi> and <hi>civill</hi> things, as to <hi>divide eſtates,</hi> Goods, Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who ſhal have which part, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169801:46"/>to chooſe Magiſtrates: So <hi>Saul</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. by Lots.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures, together with the thing or <hi>matter,</hi> ſhewes us the <hi>manner</hi> how wee ſhould uſe Lots in the like caſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it muſt be in caſe of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that things cannot ſo ſatisfactorily otherwiſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Lots ſhould be looked on as <hi>an Ordinance of God,</hi> in which God hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hand in the determination by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That therefore men ſhould in the uſe of them, <hi>look up to God in Faith and Prayer,</hi> either ſolemne or ſecret ejaculatory, to afford his ſpecial guidance in the thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe three conditions are hinted in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.18. <hi>The Lot cauſeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to ceaſe, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the Lapp, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord:</hi> And therefore, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. They <hi>prayed over</hi> the Lot.</p>
            <p>That which hath been ſayd of divine Lotts, being particularly and throughly weighed, doth eaſily overthrow ſuch Lots as are <hi>vaine, luſory, unneceſſary,</hi> and <hi>contentionary,</hi> and cauſing, or accompanying much <hi>iniquity;</hi> As in Tables, Cards, Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Diabolicall</hi> Lots, Lots of <hi>Divinations,</hi> to foretell future arbitrary events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they doe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169801:47"/>not onely want that aforeſayd which concurrs to <hi>divine</hi> Lots; or onely have that evill in them that is in <hi>luſory unneceſſary</hi> Lots (againſt which the godly learned Fathers and Ancients have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly inveighed) but there is this ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, The direction and <hi>aſſiſtance of the Devill in them;</hi> there being nothing from God, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to predict by ſuch kinde of things: The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Name</hi> hath no good Omen in it. For we all agree that <hi>Sorcery</hi> ſignifies a Diabolical Art; and on the other ſide, no man can deny, but that <hi>Sorcery</hi> is derived, <hi>a ſortibus</hi> from Lots, which (ſaith <hi>Minſh.</hi>) "men uſed that wrought by "the help of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And that this Divination by Lots was <hi>common among the Heathen,</hi> and in their Diabolical way, is commonly confeſſed in their owne Writings; as wee might abound with inſtances, <hi>Pyndar. Pyth. od.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Suet.</hi> mentions <hi>Antiatine</hi> Lots, <hi>Aponian</hi> Lots. And their Oracles were (as <hi>Gloſſ.</hi> affirmes) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And beſides all this, the <hi>manner</hi> of Lots, as caſting of a Dye, opening of a Booke, with names and predictions in it, with a thouſand more ſtrange devices to that end (if I would ſpend time to name them) doe ſmel of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Claw, I meane, they are ſuitable to Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieal inventions. And therefore this <hi>ſorcery,</hi> that is, <hi>Divination by Lots</hi> (otherwiſe then is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Word of God, as aforeſayd) is forbidden, as one kinde of thoſe Diabolical Arts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. Though I confeſſe ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed draw the prohibition from one word, others from another uſed in that place. The <hi>Syriack</hi> renders the ſecond of thoſe Diabolicall Artiſts, which our new Tranſlation renders, <hi>An obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of times:</hi> I ſay the <hi>Syriack,</hi> renders it, A <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> that is, <hi>Sortilegus,</hi> a <hi>Lot-ſorcerer,</hi> or Lot-Diviner. Other learned men alſo ſay, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169801:48"/>this kinde of <hi>ſorcery</hi> by <hi>Lots</hi> is included in the ſame word. But moſt certainely in as much as Lot-ſorcery was uſually adjoyned to moſt of the Diabolicall Arts, as before we have intimated in part; ſo it is forbidden throughout this Text, as the Appendix to the principall. And further in this alſo appeareth the Diabolicalneſſe of this <hi>Sorcery,</hi> or <hi>ſortilegie;</hi> that God never giving to ſuch things an inſtinct to predict future things, yet notwithſtanding men caſting ſuch Lots, doe put a confidence in them, that they will certainely divine future things to them. And therefore Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> affirmeth, that <q>as men doe put a confidence in theſe things, or elſe cannot attaine to any foreknowledge by them, ſo therein explicitely, or implicitly they had confederacy with the Devil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now for a briefe parallel of theſe times with theſe ancient practiſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is evident that it is common with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall Artiſts, to uſe <hi>Cataptromancy,</hi> to divine by <hi>Looking-glaſſes,</hi> therein ſhewing to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Clyents the ſhape of perſons and things which they would know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rabdomancy,</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by a <hi>Staffe,</hi> this alſo hath been practiſed, <hi>Viz.</hi> to ſet up a Staffe bolt up right, and which way it fals, thitherward for the owner to goe, as directed by a ſpeciall prediction.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:169801:48"/>
            <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Extiſpicie,</hi> or <hi>Aruſpicie,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo much followed in theſe dayes wherein all Sacrifices are exploded; but I ſuſpect there is too much of this Art in the mindes of men in theſe dayes, whiles they ſo much obſerve the birth of Monſters, either of mankinde, or beaſts. But ſuch things heeded of late yeares, as omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, have preceded onely the ruine of the freinds of that ſuperſtition; ſo that thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors have but propheſied ill to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Imagery Papiſts and Witches, doe much uſe. Of which afore.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, For <hi>Sorcery</hi> properly ſo called, <hi>Viz. Divination by Lotts;</hi> it is too much apparent how it abounds. For <hi>luſory</hi> Lots the <hi>ſtate</hi> groans under the loſſe by them, to the ruine of many men and Families; as the <hi>Churches</hi> lament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſins by them. And for other Lots, by <hi>Sieves, Bookes, &amp;c.</hi> they abound as Witchery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abounds.</p>
            <p>Was it not a ſtrange thing that a man preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome godlineſſe, and much learning, would caſt Lots to know of what judgement and practiſe hee ſhould be, in matter of Religion? And when that was determined to him, by Lot, then he caſt another Lot to know of what Society he ſhould be, to manifeſt and practice that his judgement.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Chapter: let me tel you, It
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169801:49"/>is an ill ſigne when wee are more inquiſitive to know <hi>what ſhall be,</hi> then to know <hi>what wee are,</hi> or to indeavour <hi>to be what we ought to be:</hi> And theſe times wil prompt this to you, that whiles men doe in a Diabolical way inquire after events, they neglect Gods meanes of ſalvation. And in particular, the <hi>Word;</hi> which is the true <hi>Catop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromantia</hi> to know our ſelves by a <hi>Glaſſe, James</hi> 1.23. The true <hi>Imagery</hi> to repreſent to us God and good by Chriſt, and him crucified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The true <hi>Lottery, Pſalm.</hi> 16.6. whiles men heed other things, they are apt to delude themſelves with interpretations, that are not properly Analogical to the ſignes. As <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate would conclude, that becauſe his Babylonian Horſe with his Trappings fel to the ground, therefore he ſhould have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Babylon.</hi> And <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtepping on the <hi>Affrican</hi> ſhore, and falling by the ſlipping of his foot, cryed out, claſping the Sands in his armes, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo te Affrica, I poſſeſſe thee O Affrica,</hi> though the ſtanders by looked on it as an evil ſigne.</p>

               <p>Of Necromancy, or the Black Art.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE next way of unlawful Divination, is <hi>Necromancy,</hi> or (as tis commonly called) the <hi>Black Art,</hi> which is a divining by conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the Devil appearing unto the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ſhape of one formerly dead. So the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> raiſed up to <hi>Saul</hi> ſome ſhape of <hi>Samuel.</hi> This is forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.11. There ſhal not be found among thee a <hi>Necromancer,</hi> Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>i. e. One that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the dead:</hi> Which in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under that notion of explanation. <hi>Should not a people ſeek to their God?</hi> Should they ſeek (ſo the words to be repeated) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>for, or in ſtead of the living</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>unto the dead? To the Law and the Teſtimony, if they speake not according to this rule, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> So that its juſtly called the <hi>Black Art;</hi> for there is no true light in them that uſe it. God is pleaſed to raiſe ſome from the dead extraordinarily, for that extraordinary end, to confirme the cal of them that he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great Reformers of the Church; and to cauſe men to beleeve their Doctrine. As one by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169801:50"/>
               <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. <hi>Elijah</hi> was wonderfully to reclaime the Jewes from Idolatry, in the very next Chapter. Another by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. who was <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſecond to confirme them in that Reformation. Againe, others were raiſed by Chriſt, and his Diſciples, when by them the Chriſtian Church was to be founded, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and Jewiſh Ceremonies to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And laſtly, all the Saints ſhal be raiſed (as we have proved in another Treatiſe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate on earth yet to come) when the Church is to be reſtored from all miſery, to a kinde of happineſſe on earth.</p>
            <p>But for any to raiſe men, to anſwer private men, about private phantaſies and enquiries; it is but a dreaming miſtake. It is nothing elſe but the Devil himſelfe, preſenting the ſhape of ſome dead perſons to the Diviner. For, as that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the <hi>Witch at Endor,</hi> foretold ſuch things, and ſo certainely to <hi>Saul,</hi> as argued it was not a man raiſed from the dead (for then <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are <hi>ignorant of us, Iſa.</hi> 63.16.) So ſure enough, it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelfe in that ſhape; not <hi>Samuel,</hi> or any other Saint. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They reſt from their labours in bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13. Therefore not raiſed, or made to walke (as ſome phantaſie) after their death.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:169801:50"/>
            <p>Secondly, God had afore denyed to anſwer <hi>Saul</hi> in any way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This ſhape ſuffered <hi>Saul</hi> to adore him with his face to the ground, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.14. Which the Angel in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. Would not ſuffer <hi>John</hi> to doe; much leſſe would departed Saints ſuffer it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That ſhape, if it had been <hi>Samuel,</hi> would have as wel reproved <hi>Saul</hi> of that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinne of going to <hi>Witches</hi> (contrary to the known Word of God) as of other leſſer faults, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Devil made him ſeem like <hi>Samuel,</hi> and made the Woman and <hi>Saul</hi> to think, and cal him <hi>Samuel;</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> (a peice of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha,</hi> as appeares by the Preface, craving pardon) ſaith, <hi>Samuel</hi> propheſied after his death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 46. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. But the Scripture, and reaſon ſay the contrary, and forbiddeth any ſuch way of knowledge, as we have heard.</p>
            <p>For in this Art, there appeares theſe five great evils.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Devils <hi>power</hi> (God permitting) to forme and repreſent the ſhape of any decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Devils <hi>will</hi> to be at the beck and command of the <hi>Necromancer,</hi> when he wil act any ſuch wicked deluſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Devils <hi>wit,</hi> that he can gather
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169801:51"/>out of circumſtances, when God hath forſaken a man, and left him to Satan; and what is the temper of men, what they will doe, and what wil probably follow. And if God hinder not, he wil foretel the ruine of men, or cauſe wicked men to doe as hee foretels, to come to their ruine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Devils <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> that though he be an unſpeakable proud ſpirit (witneſſe the cauſe and manner of his fal, and his malice ſtill againſt God) yet notwithſtanding his mighty pride, he wil ſtoop to the meaneſt Man, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to be at their command, whereby he may cheat them and their clients of Salvation. This obedience of the Devil to <hi>Necromancers,</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically noted in that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7. by calling the Woman-<hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> twiſe in that one Verſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>The Miſtreſſe of the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Diabolical ground of all afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd; namely, <hi>the Compact</hi> between the <hi>Devill</hi> and the <hi>Necromancer;</hi> elſe why or how could this be peculiar to ſuch filly creatures, as the Witch at <hi>Endor? Saul</hi> was a King, had in his Dominions all ſorts of Artiſts, and learned men; yet not he, nor all they could thus raiſe up the Devil, but onely the Maſters and Miſtreſſes of ſpirits, in Covenant one with another.</p>
            <p>From all inferr, firſt, That we beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partings between God and us; that we doe not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169801:51"/>depart from him, to cauſe him to depart from us; for from us begins the woe of departing. So in <hi>Saul,</hi> he went on in Rebellion againſt God; therefore God departed from him. Beware firſt of departing in <hi>Principles, Viz.</hi> to depart from the <hi>Word of God:</hi> Thence is the Originall of our departing from God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 39.15, 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. No where elſe is it ſayd, <hi>there is no remedy;</hi> becauſe to leave the <hi>Word</hi> is to leave the <hi>remedy.</hi> And this departing from the Word is the introduction to uſe Diabolical Arts. So the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> intimates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19, 20. In put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe two together, <hi>Mens ſeeking to the dead in ſtead of the living;</hi> and not going <hi>to the Law and the Teſtimony;</hi> and ſo to <hi>want light;</hi> marke it well. Secondly, Beware of departing from God in point of <hi>obedience;</hi> beware of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God contrary to the Principle of the Word. <hi>Saul</hi> diſobeying God, his ſin is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be like <hi>the ſin of Witchcraft:</hi> Becauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God, is a ſervice of the Devil, and is the introduction to encourage Satan to tempt them to his Diabolical Arts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider that if wee depart from God, and ſo cauſe him to depart from us, Satan will finde it out, and take the opportunity to tempt, as we ſee he did in the ſtory of <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That if Satan doth ſuggeſt, tempt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let us <hi>reſiſt,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, that is firſtly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169801:52"/>and fully; have no conference at all with him, which was <hi>Eves</hi> ſin and fall.* And therefore the Apoſtle warnes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Oneirologie, Oneiromancy, Somniſpicine, or Divination by dreames.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat there is ſuch an unlawful Art, is evident by the Scriptures forbidding it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>&amp;c. If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or dreamer of dreames; and giveth thee a ſigne, or a wonder, and it come to paſſe, &amp;c. thou ſhalt not hearken to them; for the Lord your God proveth you. And the Prophet, or dreamer ſhall be put to death, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 23.25. <hi>&amp;c. I have heard what the Prophets ſayd, that propheſie lyes in my name, ſaying, I have dreamed a dreame, &amp;c.</hi> By which places it appeares, that that we cal <hi>Divination by dreames,</hi> the Scripture calls Propheſying by dreames, condemning it as unlawful.</p>
            <p>That we may be cleer in the thing, note that there are foure ſorts of dreames. Firſt, <hi>Divine.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Naturall.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Humane.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Diabolicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>muſt needs be lawfull</hi> and <hi>pre-ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative.</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:169801:52"/>The ſecond and third <hi>may be lawfull:</hi> Namely, lawful as to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of dreaming; as thinking and ſpeaking according to the actings of reaſon; and they may be ſomehow <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the fourth <hi>cannot</hi> be either <hi>lawfull,</hi> or <hi>pre-ſignificative,</hi> or <hi>ſignificative,</hi> unleſſe it be to ſhew that which may be ſeen without a dreame, <hi>Viz.</hi> that ſuch a man is much under the power of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Divine dreames are either <hi>immediately</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a mans <hi>underſtanding</hi> by the <hi>spirit of God, Numb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Job</hi> 33.15. Or <hi>mediately</hi> by an <hi>Angel</hi> preſented to the <hi>phantaſie,</hi> and by the phantaſmes thereof conveighed to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13. For as the Devil being a moſt intelligent and ſubtile ſpirit, can (as we know by ſad experience) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into our phantaſies, both waking and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch evil things, and make our minds receive them thence and thinke upon them, which not onely our <hi>grace,</hi> but our very <hi>reaſon</hi> abhorrs; ſo much more a good Angel deputed by God to that end, can good things. Now for theſe extraordinary divine dreames.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is moſt probable that they are ceaſed. <hi>Keckerman,</hi> a godly and moſt learned man, both in Divinity and Philoſophy, hath theſe words in his natural Philoſophy, <hi>Syſt. Phiſ. l.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 29.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169801:53"/>
               <hi>Cum ſomnia, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> 
               <q>Seeing that Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal dreames may impoſe themſelves upon men, as if they were divine; therefore they are to be judged and diſcerned, or diſcriminated by theſe two rules. Firſt, That after the light of the Goſpel is manifeſted, God doth no more act by dreames. Secondly, Whatſoever dreame is conjoyned with the danger of ſome ſinne or ſuperſtition, albeit it may ſeeme divine, yet it is a Diabolical dreame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee how his judgement is, that divine dreames are ceaſed to Chriſtians: And it ſeemes ſo to me, becauſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. tis ſayd, <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhall faile:</hi> Greek, be done away. <hi>Tongues ceaſe.</hi> And <hi>knowledge done away, i.e.</hi> Knowledge of Myſteries of Revelations, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. Now we ſee the <hi>gift of tongues gone;</hi> and the <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Myſteries;</hi> and ſo in like manner <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies.</hi> Therefore in oppoſition to all former wayes of manifeſtation, the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. puts an emphaſis on Chriſt ſpeaking, <hi>God ſpeakes to us in theſe laſt dayes by his Son.</hi> Chriſt by his Apoſtles to be the laſt extraordinary ſpeaking, til Chriſt come againe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is evident that the divine Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical dreames of them mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r different from divinatory or divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreames which this evil Age runs after.</p>
            <p>Firſt difference: Thoſe truely divine dreames
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169801:53"/>concerned the great affaires of God, were of high concernment to his Church: As firſt, of the comming of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The alterations of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that have oppoſed the Church: As that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 2. He had the Shel of the dreame, but <hi>Daniel</hi> the Kernel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The preſervation of the Church, as that dreame whereof <hi>Pharoah</hi> had the Shel the type, but <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Kernel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Or to bring his Saints into requeſt for interpretation of dreames, as an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſome great deſigne; therefore God put dreames into carnal men, that his Saints might interpret them, and be advanced for the good of the Church: So <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. in the Story of the <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Baker:</hi> And ſo in part to that end was <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To pull down Antichriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.12.</p>
            <p>Second Difference: Divine dreames were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very evident in the <hi>thing:</hi> The type was plaine to ſignifie what it meant; as <hi>Jacobs Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c.</hi> to ſignifie Gods preſence ſhould be with him. Or the type was doubled in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the perſon: As <hi>Gen,</hi> 37. <hi>Your</hi> Sheaves did <hi>obeyſance</hi> to mine. <hi>The Sun and Moone, and eleven ſtarrs made obeyſance to me.</hi> Or elſe there was a plaine interpretation given to him that dreamed, as to <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7. or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169801:54"/>as to <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreame, to <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> dreame, or to both. As to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and to his Parents and Brethren, who all underſtood the meaning; or the type was plaine and doubled, and an interpretation too was given; as of that of <hi>Pharoahs eares of Corn, and the Kine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God either made impreſſions of aſſurance on good mens heatts that dreamed, what was the meaning; or God ſent his <hi>Angels</hi> to expound to them, as to <hi>Daniel;</hi> or elſe exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened the Saints by his ſpirit, to interpret the dreames of others: As they ſayd of <hi>Joſeph</hi> interpreting of dreames, that <hi>he was full of the ſpirit of God, Gen.</hi> 41.38.</p>
            <p>Third Difference: Divine dreames are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the revealed will of God. They doe not contrary it, but Comment and enlarge upon it. See all along the Bible, the dreames that come after, enlarge upon the truth revealed afore.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Divine dreames alwayes tend to promote truth, holineſſe, godlineſſe, edification, and the glory of God by theſe. We heard what <hi>Keckerman</hi> ſayd afore; to which we add what he adds, <hi>Whatſoever dreames tend to ſuperſtition, and not to the glory of God, are Diabolicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that dreames are not to be judged but by all theſe jointly; not by the <hi>ſubject at all,</hi> for badd men as well as good men have dreamed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169801:54"/>true divine dreames: Nor by the <hi>object onely;</hi> becauſe ſome things may be lawful in all dreams but by the <hi>weightineſſe of matter;</hi> by the <hi>cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of the <hi>manner;</hi> by their <hi>agreeableneſſe to the Word,</hi> and their <hi>end to promote godlineſſe,</hi> and Gods glory.</p>
            <p>But we have no ſuch dreames of future things in theſe dayes; and therefore we are not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a juſtifiable Divination by dreames. If we by heavenly mindedneſſe, and by helpe of the ſpirit of God, dreame of the future judgement, eternall bliſſe, the ruine of the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or any thing elſe knowne to us by the Word of God; theſe are dreames of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, not propheticall dreames; or meditationall not divinatory dreames.</p>
            <p>And if we have no propheticall divine dreams which proceed from God, and carry our mindes towards God according to his Word, we have no ſort of divinatory dreames left us, but ſuch as we are to ſpeak againſt, as to the matter of divination and foretelling by them; accordingly as God (we heard afore) ſpeaks againſt them in his Word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Therefore wee come to <hi>Naturall dreames,</hi> which ariſe from meer naturall cauſes, as either from the predominant qualities of a mans complexion in health, or from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding humour of his body in his ſickneſſe,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169801:55"/>or inclination to ſickneſſe. Tis true that a man that is not an Idiot hath many notions of divine and humane things in his head, whereon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in his naturall dreames, and to add, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and divide, and make up the whole phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie; but the riſe and ſpring from whence theſe naturall dreames proceed, are the predominant qualities and overflowing humours of the body; ſo that according to them is the complexion and Syſtem of the dreame. As from the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of blood in the <hi>ſanguine complexion</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed dreames of cheerful colours, things, actions, as of red and damask Roſes and flowers, purple ſaffron flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of muſick, banquets, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, leapings, laughings, jeſtings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the predominancy of <hi>Flegme</hi> in the fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick complexion, proceed dreames of waters, navigation, ſwimming, fiſhing, bathes, raines, ſnowes, lakes, rivers, drownings; as alſo of weight hindring ones going, which is by reaſon of Flegme oppreſing and ſlugging the ſtomack and body.</p>
            <p>From the predominancy of <hi>Coller,</hi> like unto the <hi>yellow</hi> colour, and fretfull temper thereof, proceed dreames of yellow things, as alſo of brawlings, fightings, battels, burnings; and ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſpeedy fury of this temper, of flying.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Melancholly</hi> predominant, ſutable to the black colour, and earthy, cold, and heavy temper
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169801:55"/>thereof, proceed dreames of black ſmoakes, and vapours, of darkneſſe, of night, of death, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſolitary places, of ruines of old buildings, of Hell, of the Devil, of ſtrangling, of cutting off of the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore theſe dreames ſignifie a mans naturall temper, or ſickly diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but doe not preſignifie any thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Humane</hi> dreams. Some Philoſophers cal them <hi>Animall</hi> dreames: It may be the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe kinde of dreames being ſuch as are formed in the night out of ſuch images and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations which the phantaſie had conceived in the day time; the Images and repreſentations of the actions and things we had to doe with in the day being newly impreſſed upon the <hi>animall ſpirits,</hi> and inhering there more tenaciouſly, doe lye in thoſe <hi>animall ſpirits,</hi> as in a ſtorehouſe, ready for the operation of the phantaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them and digeſt them into dreames. But becauſe Beaſts have phantaſies, and we ſee that Doggs doe dreame, and that mens dreames have ſome notions of rationality in them; therefore deſervedly I call theſe dreames <hi>Humane</hi> dreams. Of theſe the Scripture ſpeakes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>A dreame commeth through the multitude of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And we finde it true by many experiences, that all men as they uſe different Arts or wayes, dream differently; which <hi>Claudian</hi> the Poet limbs out to the life; thus,</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169801:56"/>
            <lg>
               <l>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Which in ſumme briefly is this; <q>What ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible notions we revolve in the day, returne in the ſleep of night. The wearyed <hi>Hunter</hi> repoſed to ſleep, hath his minde upon Woods and Denns of wilde Beaſts; Judges dreame of Controverſies; <hi>Waggoners,</hi> or <hi>Coachmen,</hi> of Waggons or Coaches, and their chary run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with their Horſes, their Stages. And <hi>Mee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Claudian</hi>) the <hi>ſtudy of the Muſes</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite me in the ſleep of night, with their daily arts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore theſe dreames doe rather <hi>poſt-ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> then <hi>preſignifie;</hi> they doe after ſignifie what we have been doing, or at moſt <hi>ſignifie</hi> what is the habit of our mindes; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, the <hi>juſt man dreames of juſtice;</hi> as experience will tell a man habituated to a particular vice, that he will dreame of the acting that vice. But they do not preſignifie what men ſhall doe more then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169801:56"/>the diſpoſition and habit in their mindes wil tel them in the day time, if acquainted with their owne hearts; what they are likely to doe if they ſtrive not againſt it; much leſſe doe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie what ſhall befall them, more then what naturally attends the acting of thoſe habits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Wee finde by experience that ofttimes what we dreame doth punctually come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But dreames as dreames (which is the pin of the queſtion) doe not preſignifie: Many things may come to paſſe according to our dreames which are not foretold us by vertue of our dreames: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some events are meerly contingent and accidentall as to our dreames; ſo much <hi>Kecher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and the great Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>Quaedam ſomnia ſunt</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>non ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficativa ſed fortuita:</hi> As ſuppoſe a man in his ſecond ſleep ſhould dreame it would be day by and by. This dawning of the day by and by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his dreame, though <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, was meerly <hi>contingent</hi> to the dreame: It was by hap that the dreame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, and ſo the dawning followed it. And hundred inſtances of the like nature may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but that we much endeavour brevity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some day-notions of the phantaſie are paſſionate, moving much hope, or feare, at leaſt upon ſome probabilities. According to theſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169801:57"/>deeper impreſſions, a man more pronely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly dreams. Tis true, thoſe probable things come to paſſe; but not as foretold by our dreams, but rather by our waking probable feares, and hopes that ſuch things would come to paſſe. As to dreame upon probable conjecture; that we ſhall heare of the death of ſuch a deare Freind, whoſe death wee feared with our waking thoughts, becauſe we have not according to the former wont heard of them in ſuch a ſpace of time, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly, ſoon after, we heare he is dead.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a natural and rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance between cauſes and effects, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſignes and things, neceſſarily connexed in nature. Hereupon in our day meditations we foreſee ſuch a thing, and in our night ſleep we dreame the ſame; and the thing comes to paſſe. Twas juſt waking reaſon predicted this, not vaine dreames by night: As the ſhining of light at the dawning rather foreſhews the Sunne is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to riſe, then a body ſtanding open to the Eaſt foreſhewes it by caſting a ſhadow towards the Weſt; our dreames by night are but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in compariſon of our waking reaſon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Many heeding dreames rather out of a ſinfull ſuperſtition, then for any juſt cauſe, give up themſelves with a kinde of confidence and ſubjection, that ſo it ſhall be, and it muſt be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169801:57"/>ſo with them, and can be no otherwiſe then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dreames; and hereby tempt themſelves to doe that which they dreamed. So that it comes to paſſe becauſe they will doe it; not predicted it will come to paſſe becauſe they dreamed it: Juſt as ſome melancholly perſons doe many ſtrange things onely becauſe they had a ſtrange phantaſie they muſt doe it, they ſhould not avoyd it, but muſt needs doe it; though the neceſſity was nothing in the dependance of things, or of themſelves with thoſe things; but onely in the ſwimming imagination of their own braine.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Satan doth oft tempt the ſonnes of men to doe according to the dreames of dream-regarders; that ſo he may bring his Diabolical dreames by this introduction into credit; of which we ſhall ſpeake by and by: So that in this artifice the dreames of men predict nothing, but onely Satan by permiſſion, effects an event ſutable to the dreame. Juſt as one ſhould be talking of his adverſary, that he dreamed his adverſary gave him a blow on the eare, and an ill neighbour hearing this diſcourſe ſhould goe forth and perſwade that adverſary when hee meets-that dreamer, to give him a blow on the eare, and he doth it, but had not done it but by perſwaſion of that ill neighbour. Now doth it at all follow that there was any prediction in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169801:58"/>this dreame: Juſt ſo is it in the Devils temptings and effectings according to mens dreames. And this may be as well in other men, and their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, of which another man dreames, as wel as in the man and his owne affaires who dreamed that dreame.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, God in juſt judgement on dreame-heeders, doth permit, and by his providence give way that their dreams ſhould be ſomewhat fulfilled; ſo that theſe things come to paſſe, not according to a vertue of prediction in dreames, but by the juſt judgement of God, becauſe men afore they ſleep, doe not pray againſt ſinfull dreames; and after ſleep doe not ſlight their dreames, but credit them and confide in them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Thus of the third ſort of dreames, which we cal <hi>Humane</hi> dreames. Fourthly, wee come to <hi>Diabolicall</hi> dreames. That the Devil can be the maine cauſe of dreames, which we call Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is apparent, in that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, He hath been ſuch a cauſe of dreames, as we ſhal ſhew by and by; therefore he can be ſo ſtill, his wit and wickedneſſe not ceaſing; and theſe times not better in reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but rather worſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He can ſuggeſt, as appeares by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, evill thoughts to us when we are awaking, different from the many objects and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169801:58"/>things that then our ſenſes, and thoughts are drawne after; therefore much more to us, when the operation of the ſenſes ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If he could <hi>repreſent</hi> evill dictates <hi>before</hi> the minde of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. He can inject them into us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Devill that can preſent the ſhape of a dead man to living <hi>Saul,</hi> can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent other Images and imaginations of things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Good Angels have cauſed good dreames, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. Therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and by the rule of contraries, badd Angels can cauſe badd dreames.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt. How may wee know any of theſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall dreames, ſeeing evill dreames may ariſe from inward corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, by the contraries to the notes of divine Prophetical dreames; as when dreams ſeem never ſo good in the matter of them, yet they are darke and confuſed in the digeſt; and are of perſonal ſlight things, and doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the revealed truth of the Word, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of converſation, and the glory of God; but rather have a tendency, and conſequence to lead to ſuperſtition. For ſuch dreames as theſe, are without the ſphere of proper natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, or humane actions; and therefore muſt be from Satan: Eſpecially when,</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man hath a ſtrong impreſſion on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169801:59"/>his minde, that ſuch dreames are Propheticall, or divinatory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They muſt needs be Diabolical when they proceed neither from any obſervation of the ſenſes, or actions of the body, or phantaſies of the minde in the day time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When they are horrid, not onely to grace, but where no grace is, even to morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, civility, common reaſon, and the inſtinct of poor lapſed nature.</p>
            <p>If all theſe ſignes be not ſufficient, that which followes of the general, and ſpecials of Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall dreames, as we have it in <hi>Keckerman. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Maximus,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Alſted;</hi> who tel us,</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169801:60"/>as he did in the <hi>Maniches</hi> (holding that there was a good God and a badd God that were eternal, the authors of all things.

            <p>For now men generally are much given over to unlawfull <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> they <hi>write Books,</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and leſſer Volumes of it.

                  <p>Of the nature of Aſtrologie in ſome diſtinctions, deſcriptions, and obſervations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>If I ſhould diſtinguiſh of <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> as <hi>Alſted</hi> doth, calling it, <hi>Aſtrologia judiciaria,</hi> that is, <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologie,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Geree</hi> call it; or ſhould I diſtinguiſh as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Willet,</hi> that this Art is partly <hi>Theoricall,</hi> partly <hi>Practicall,</hi> and the <hi>practicall</hi> as partly <hi>allowed,</hi> and partly <hi>rejected;</hi> as if hereby wee would ſeparate and ſet a part for lawfull uſe, the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing of any kinde of Aſtrologie;</hi> tis of our indulgence, and more then we need to doe. For keeping to our tearmes, either firſt to the tearme <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> it is no where allowed in the Scripture, under that notion, but every where ſpoken againſt, as we ſhall ſee afterward.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169801:62"/>As other things that are naturall, which are brought to countenance Aſtrology, are not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by the <hi>Eucyclopaedia,</hi> and general order, and ſeats of all Arts and Sciences, within their owne ſpheres, to be accounted Aſtrology.</p>
               <p>For inſtance; firſt, ſome urge that we know the <hi>Tydes of the Sea by the ſtate of the Moone;</hi> and <hi>tempeſts by other Starrs, &amp;c.</hi> but theſe, and or the like nature, ſay we, are properly handled in that part of <hi>naturall Philoſophy</hi> which we cal <hi>Meteorologie;</hi> as alſo are all fiery Meteors, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which the eſſentiall internall cauſes, <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> and one externall, namely the <hi>end,</hi> belong thereunto, are there handled, and thereby are made an integral part of <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> For if you will ſay, becauſe of their externall efficient cauſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Starrs, they are to be handled as a part of <hi>Aſtrologie:</hi> by the ſame reaſon there will be left no ſuch Science as <hi>naturall Philoſophy,</hi> becauſe all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bodies below the Moon (as ſaith the great Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) depend upon the ſuperiour Celeſtiall bodies of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others ſay, that by Aſtrologie we know <hi>Ecclipſes,</hi> and changes of the Moon: But ſay we, <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> doth challenge this, whoſe proper worke is to teach us the Spheres, Planets, and nominated fixed Starrs, with their motions, meaſures, diſtances, conjunctions, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169801:63"/>whence ariſe Ecclipſes of the Sunne, or Starrs, and changes of the Moon. I give but a touch upon ſome particulars, as an hint to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men to conceive of the reſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If any urge that Aſtrologie handles of the <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of the Starrs: We reply, that ſo doth Aſtronomie of <hi>their qualities;</hi> namely, of their light and colour; and naturall Philoſophy of their <hi>effects</hi> in watery, aiery, and firy Meteors.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, if we admit of another terme, or title which <hi>Alſted</hi> gives to <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> calling it, <hi>Aſtrologia Planetaria, i. e.</hi> Planetarie Aſtrology; then we demand what becomes of almoſt all the Syſtem of pretended Aſtrology, if its ground-worke be founded mainely on the Planets (the maine part of Aſtronomy?) What then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the notions about the tenth Orbe, the twelve houſes of the Heavens, the twelve Signes, with hundreds more of ſuch kinde of knacks wherewith they are wont to build up Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, If we entertaine thoſe other tearmes and titles that <hi>Alſted,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, &amp;c.</hi> give to Aſtrologie, calling it <gap reason="foreign">

So the Crow cryes againſt raine, becauſe the moyſture of the ayre affects his feathers: And the Dolphin againſt a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſwimms aloft, becauſe the Sand in the bottome is ſtirred. For theſe creatures that are led onely by ſenſe, have a quicker feeling of ſuch naturall accidents, then man hath, who is moſt occupied in the uſe and exerciſe of reaſon: For, <hi>Attentio ad operationes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum rationem, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>The attending upon the operations of reaſon, doth take away the attention to the operation of nature:</hi> And therefore FOOLES and SIMPLE perſons,

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169801:66"/>to him by me, touching <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologie,</hi> told me this remarkable Story of himſelfe; When he came to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> firſt he thought it a fine thing to be of <hi>Gods Counſell,</hi> to foreknow ſecrets, and reſolved to have that knowledge, what labour ſoever it coſt him; and ſo early ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelfe to the ſtudy of the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> beginning with <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Geometrie,</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy;</hi> and to lay a good foundation, he left none of theſe Arts, till he had attained exactneſſe in them: The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus layd, he then applyed himſelfe to his maine ſcope, the ſearch of <hi>Judiciall Aſtrologie:</hi> But there he found his expectation fruſtrate; THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY in the rules thereof; when he had tyred his body and wits in vaine, he was much dejected with the fruſtrating of his expectation: At laſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to a man in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> famous in that Art, and a <hi>practitioner in Prognoſtications by it:</hi> to him he made his moane what paines he had taken to be expert in <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and how the uncertainty of the rules of that Art did now defeat his hopes: The <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> reply was, that THE RULES OF THAT ART WERE UNCERTAINE INDEED, NEITHER WAS THERE ANY CURE FOR IT: whereupon Maſter <hi>Brigs</hi> relinquiſht that ſtudy. And he did then affirme to me, that <hi>he would undertake
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169801:67"/>to the skilfulleſt Aſtrologer in the World, that let him ſet downe any concluſion, touching any man or State; yea or</hi> WEATHER, <hi>and hee would prove it</hi> CONTRADICTORILY; that is, <hi>Both that it would fall out ſo, and that it would not fall out ſo, from their owne Rules and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> whence (ſaith he) you may ſee appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently that there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> in the rules of that Art: He further added, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was; <hi>To thoſe that addicted themſelves to the practiſes of Divining Aſtrologie, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill did at firſt ſecretly lend his aſſiſtance;</hi> and at length, <hi>Gradatim</hi> (that is, Gradually) did (unleſſe God prevented) <hi>Entice them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169801:72"/>that it ſignifies <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> The inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations againſt Aſtrologie in this Text, are, firſt, That it ſeemes prejudicate to Gods <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> For when God would here comfort his people againſt Aſtrologers Predictions, threatning evil to them, the Lord that is moſt wiſe, to order his words, begins with this preface: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the wombe, that maketh all things, and that Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the Heavens. and ſpreadeth abroad the Earth:</hi> Intending plainly thus much: Feare not <hi>bondage</hi> under evill men and things, as the Aſtrologers threaten, for I am thy <hi>Redeemer,</hi> that redeemes thee from troubles, in ſpight of all Aſtrology.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond intimation is, That God doth <hi>call,</hi> and can and will <hi>make</hi> thoſe Aſtrologers and Diviners, <hi>Lyars,</hi> and <hi>madd men:</hi> All their predictions ſhal

The Herbrew Doctors alſo expound it Aſtrologers. <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> doth derive it from the Arabian Language, in which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Alhabram,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Deciſion of a matter;</hi> as (ſaith he) the Aſtrologers are ſo called, who decide and determine things by the preſcript of the Starrs. And to put the matter out of doubt, that the Lord meanes Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he uſeth another word, by which he gives them a ſecond name, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is Gazers IN the Starrs.

The <hi>Chaldee Targum</hi> doth alſo ſo render it; namely, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gazers <hi>in</hi> or <hi>into</hi> the Starrs: And their third name, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which our Engliſh renders, <hi>Monethly Prognoſticators: Vatablus</hi> renders, <hi>thoſe who declare what ſhall come to paſſe every
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169801:73"/>ſeverall moneth.</hi> The Arabian Verſion of this Verſe renders them all three thus, <hi>Let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and deliver thee, who preſage future things by the Starrs of Heaven; who contemplate the Starrs, and foretell thee what event ſhall be to thee.</hi> All (you ſee) amounts to this, that without faile, Aſtrologers are here ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. And how?</p>
               <p>Firſt, As <hi>oppoſite to confidence in God:</hi> As our Notes on the Bible affirme in theſe words, <hi>He derideth</hi> (ſay they) <hi>their vaine confidence, that put their truſt in any thing but in God, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo ſuch Sciences which ſerve to no uſe, but to delude the people, and to bring them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As of the <hi>ſame ranke,</hi> and much of the ſame abomination with <hi>Enchanters</hi> and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers. Babylon</hi> uſeth both; and as we heard afore, from them that went farr in Aſtrologie; that Aſtrologers that uſually hitt any thing right, cannot doe it but by helpe from the Devil.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As a thing to be <hi>derided,</hi> that any men ſhould undertake to preſage good, when tis the counſell of God to bring evill upon a people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As <hi>a juſt thing with God</hi> to ſend ſuch to their Aſtrologers in the day of evil of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them, to ſee if they can deliver them.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:169801:74"/>
               <p>Fifthly, As that God <hi>will the rather bring ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible judgement</hi> on a people that beſides their evils, doe beleeve Aſtrologers that they ſhall doe wel.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That in the day of calamity, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Aſtrologers, and thoſe that beleeved them ſhall fall by the hotteſt furie of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The fifth place of Scripture againſt Aſtrology is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Learne not the way of the Heathen, and be not diſmayed at the ſignes of Heaven, for the Heathen are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at them. For the cuſtomes of the people are vaine.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>a ſigne or token,</hi> doth ſometimes and eſpecially when joyned with Heaven, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a prodigious portentous, ominous ſigne. The word is the ſame, and the intent of the Text the ſame, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (afore diſcuſſed) <hi>that fruſtrateth the Tokens, or ſignes of the Lyars.</hi> The <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes on our Bibles on the word SIGNES, ſay thus; <hi>God forbiddeth his people to give credit or feare the Conſtellations and Conjunctions of Starrs and Planets, which have no power of themſelves, but are governed by him; and their ſecret motions and influences are not knowne to man, and therefore there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine judgement thereof, Deut.</hi> 18.9. And the ſame <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes on the word <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> ſay thus; <hi>Meaning</hi> (ſay they) <hi>not onely the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169801:74"/>of the Starrs, but their Lawes and Ceremonies, whereby they confirme their Idolatry;</hi> ſo the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes. I quote them and others the more, that yee may ſee, not onely mine, but the judgement of the generality of the godly and Learned touching Aſtrology. I add, As Aſtrology and Idolatry are conjoyned here in the prohibition, ſo alſo was it in the practiſe of men: For they Idolatrouſly made Gods of the Starrs, as of <hi>Saturne, Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c.</hi> as the names of our week-dayes doe unhappily to this day ſignifie. And they alſo did Aſtrological<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe them to foretel by. And indeed in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction by them they made Gods of them. For future things are in Gods hands, and not for us to know till he will make them knowne by his Word; or performe them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe renders that of the Text of <hi>Signes</hi> thus; <hi>And be not afrayd of the ſignes that are put in Heaven:</hi> which muſt needs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Starrs:</hi> And the Hebrew word for <hi>Feare</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to caſt downe upon the earth with feare; which muſt intimate rather a <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>evill ſignifications,</hi> then of <hi>adoration.</hi> The intimations againſt Aſtrology here, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is the <hi>way of the Heathen.</hi> Now we, whom God hath with ſo much coſt and care diſtinguiſhed from the World, muſt not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:169801:75"/>
               <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Cuſtomes of the people</hi> in that and other things, are vaine; and tis not for Gods people to run after vaine things, but rather as a ſigne of their repentance to doe as <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Paul, Phillip.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the regarding of ſuch things cauſeth in men <hi>an evill feare,</hi> oppoſite to their confidence and comfort in God: So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet intimats in exhorting them not <hi>to fear them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That to feare any Aſtrology, or ſignes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an <hi>Heatheniſh thing:</hi> Wee doe not as Beleevers, but as Heathens. Godly men, yea all men that profeſſe the true God, ought to goe to that God, and to him onely to know the hidden things that are future. For it is the priviledge of God onely, to foretell ſuch things to come, either by himſelfe or by his ſpirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily in his Prophets; and therefore not communicated to Starrs: And whatſoever we ſet up, as imagining they are able to predict ſuch future things, we advance up into the place of God, which are not Gods; as is manifeſt by this very thing, that they cannot really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predict ſuch things: And therefore to goe to any thing to know ſuch things to come, but to God himſelf, is to doe as Heathens that ſet up falſe Gods, and not as men that acknowledge the true God. And this is fully and plainely held
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169801:75"/>forth to us, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>In Verſ.</hi> 10. to 21. the Lord having propheſied and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told good things to come to paſſe for his people, he in a holy manner thus taunteth all other things that are ſet up by men in which they put confidence, as if they were Gods to declare hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things, <hi>paſt,</hi> or <hi>to come; Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;c. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your cauſe, ſaith the Lord, bring forth your ſtrong reaſons, ſaith the King of Jacob; let them bring them forth, and ſhew us what ſhall happen. Let them ſhew the former things what they be, that we may conſider them, and Know the latter end of them, or Declare to us things to come: Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know yee are GODS, &amp;c. Behold yee are of nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We doe not count it conſiderable to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to diſcuſſe here, what is the thing mainly meant in this place; as whether <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie,</hi> (ſure enough in Aſtrologie by them that confide in it for predictions, there is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> enough, as this Text ſufficiently intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) but we attend the Argument to confute it, <hi>Viz.</hi> Becauſe it cannot <hi>foretell things to come; Becauſe that is Gods Prerogative alone.</hi> And therefore nor <hi>Idolls</hi> nor <hi>Starrs;</hi> neither <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> nor <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> can predict things to come: For as <hi>Idolatry</hi> is but <hi>vanity,</hi> as tis oft called in Scripture: As <hi>the vanities of the Nations, or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169801:76"/>Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> So Aſtrologie is a <hi>lye, Jer.</hi> 50.35, 36.

Seventhly, They thought that becauſe they could not tell this dreame, that therefore <hi>no man on earth elſe could;</hi> and that therefore the King was <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> to require of them to tel it; intimating ſtrongly, their incomparable ability and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their wicked Arts, <hi>that what poſſibly could be done in that nature,</hi> by any, <hi>could be done by them.</hi> Eightly, That God according to <hi>his Prerogative could reveale it to Daniel;</hi> and ſo confuted the Lyes of the Aſtrologers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ninthly, That the Heathen King was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by throughly convinced, that there <hi>was no God like the true God,</hi> whom <hi>Daniel</hi> and all godly men doe worſhip.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, Note that the word <hi>Magician</hi> and <hi>Magick</hi> (ſo oft uſed in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and joyned there with Aſtrologers and Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy) is by the vote of the Learned generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the New Teſtament in the worſe ſenſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. oft. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.

                  </gap>, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſuch as uſed deviliſh Arts; it is taken in an ill ſenſe; as of that brood (afore they repented) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Acts 19.18, 19, 20. <hi>Many of them which uſed curious arts, brought their Books together to be burned before all men, and counted the price of them fifty thouſand peices of Silver.</hi> The moſt of theſe Books, in moſt probability were Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Bookes, for Divination; becauſe, firſt, The Arts are called <hi>Curious arts;</hi> that is, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the <hi>Rules and Principles</hi> above common meanes of knowledge, and curious in their <hi>end and uſe,</hi> to predict things that were not to be knowne ordinarily. Secondly, They were Book-arts, which are chiefly of Aſtrology; few, if any, are written of <hi>Sorcery, Necromancy, &amp;c.</hi> but come downe from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Tradition. Thirdly, Their price great, <hi>Viz.</hi> Six thouſand two hundred and fifty pounds ſterling, which imports alſo Aſtrological Books, becauſe none others of unlawful and ſinful Arts (as they all are here intimated) are ſo much valued, as Aſtrological Books. Fourthly, Its a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169801:78"/>thing apparently knowne to men acquainted with Antiquitie, that theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> were greatly addicted to Aſtrology and Book-magick. Therefore the <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> render <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arts</hi> by <hi>Magick.</hi> All which ſorts of Arts are condemned under the name of <hi>Sorceries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 21.8. as thoſe which ſhall abound in the laſt times, afore the fal of Antichriſt, as by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience we doe already finde.</p>
               <p>To theſe things out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the New Teſtament, I might add much, both of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Criticiſmes of Languages, to ſtreng-then our aſſertion; but the conveniencies of this little Volume conſtraines me to contract my ſelfe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing reaſons or arguments againſt Aſtrologie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The firſt is from the <hi>Conceſſion</hi> of the Freinds of Aſtrology: They grant that either of theſe four may prevent the predictions of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; namely, either the <hi>prudence</hi> of a morall wiſe man, or the <hi>piety</hi> of a godly man, or the <hi>tutelarity of Angels,</hi> or the <hi>providence of God</hi> over-ruling all things; much more all foure concurring, may anticipate. Now theſe foure ſwallow up, and gripe within their ſphere all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169801:78"/>things, eſpecially arbitrary things: What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence cannot doe, grace can; if not, Angels may: and where all faile, providence doth order according to the minde of God, <hi>who worketh</hi> ALL <hi>things according to the counſell of his owne will, Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. Tis ſayd, ALL THINGS; for, <hi>not a Sparrow falls to the ground without his will.</hi> And <hi>all the haires of our head are numbered, Matth.</hi> 10.29, 30. Which our Saviour ſpeakes to comfort Beleevers againſt bodily dangers, and corporal cauſes of feares. And on the other ſide, tis not ſayd in that 1 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 11. <hi>He worketh all things according to the</hi> STARRS; which are <hi>viſible</hi> things, and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neceſſary cauſes;</hi> but according to the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell</hi> (which is ſecret and inviſible) <hi>of his owne will</hi> (which is arbitrary and free.) And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it more ſignificantly and emphatically, that God doth not rule by a deputation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Starrs, eſpecially in things either hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and arbitrary, or ſpiritual; tis ſayd hee <hi>ruleth all things after the counſell of his</hi> OVVN WILL. Which being ſet over againſt the many ſoare invectives the Lord makes againſt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical obſervers of the Starrs demonſtrate ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to them that will underſtand, that there is no certainety in predictions from the Starrs. This argument might be much enlarged to good purpoſe; but a word to the wiſe is ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:169801:79"/>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is from <hi>cleere experience</hi> of Twins conceived at the ſame inſtant, and borne in the ſame houre, or leſſe; and it may be put forth themſelves in part, at the wombe enterchangably in that houre (as <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> did, <hi>Gen,</hi> 38.) yet before God put any difference by any inward change by grace, the Twins may be of an apparent vaſt difference of Complexion, as we ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> at their firſt birth. And experence knowes of other Twins, either bot <hi>naturall</hi> or both <hi>spirituall,</hi> that farr different events in the World have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them. Where then is the certainety of Starr-predictions? Where is the verity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology? It may be they will read us a Lecture of difference from <hi>magnitudes</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of Starrs; that ſome are bigger then the Earth, ſome leſſer; againe, that ſome finiſh ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in twenty foure houres, others not other motions in ſo many ſcores of yeares, or more. But if this be their defence, the matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting Aſtrology is thereby made to me more incredible: For if (as they ſay, with <hi>Keckerman</hi>) the <hi>Moone</hi> be leſſe then the Earth at leaſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times, and the reſt of the Planets below the Sunne proportionably, as <hi>Venus</hi> twenty ſeven times leſſe then the Earth; and <hi>Mercury</hi> two and twenty: How then ſhall theſe at any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, at any one and the ſame time effect or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169801:79"/>any thing to all the World? For all the Aſtrologers in the World will undertake to prognoſticate from theſe Planets upon all men on Earth, borne at one and the ſame houre. If the <hi>Sunne,</hi> as they confeſſe, be about an hundred and ſixty times bigger then the Earth; and all the Planets above the Sun proportionably; as that <hi>Saturne</hi> is fourſcore and eleven times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the Earth;; <hi>Jupiter</hi> fourſcore and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene times; <hi>Mars</hi> one time bigger, with one third; how then is it that there is difference of natures and events in thouſands borne at the ſame houre, and eſpeciall in Twins, as we ſayd afore. If they ſay that this is becauſe of the ſwift externall violent motion of all the Starrs, <hi>Planets,</hi> and <hi>Fixed;</hi> that they are hurryed round the Earth by the firſt movable from Eaſt to Weſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in twenty foure houres; which is to runn ſixty times ſixty Miles in every houre, then we demand how can the Starrs have time to make any diſtinct impreſſion by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar influence on one borne, eſpecially on one who perhaps may lie in the mouth of the womb, partly borne, partly unborne, ſometimes in the head and foreparts, ſometimes in the hinder parts, for a quarter or halfe an houre, or many houres. Or what Aſtrologer upon the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe motions, and the ſlowneſſe of the birth, which cannot be borne in an inſtant, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169801:80"/>at beſt gradually, ſhall be able to prognoſticate punctually that ſuch Starrs, with ſuch influence, did ſo complexionate ſuch an Infant at ſuch a <hi>Minuit</hi> of time? For by the computation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, the Starrs run, in the ſayd motion, in every minuit of the hour ſixty Miles. If Aſtrologers wil plead any thing to help themſelves herein, from the ſlowneſſe of other motions of the Starrs, that are natural, and internal to them; as that all the <hi>fixed Starrs</hi> (which are knowne by their twinckling to our ſight) move from North to South (as they ſay, ſo <hi>Alſted</hi>) in three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred yeares, and back againe in three thouſand five hundred yeares; ſo that they finiſh not that motion under ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares; how then can any Age ſince the beginning of the World have experience what the Conjunction of the Starrs may produce? So for the motions of the ſeven <hi>Planets:</hi> If they ſay (as <hi>Keckerman, &amp;c.</hi> affirme) that the Sun hath three Orbes: Firſt, that in which the Sun it ſelfe is fixed, and is the middle Orbe, and is excentricall to the World; that is, The World, or Earth is not juſt in the middle of it; by reaſon whereof the Sun is ſometimes in the <hi>Perige,</hi> namely neerer the Earth for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths; and ſometimes in the <hi>Apoge,</hi> to wit, more remote from the Earth, for other moneths. And in this <hi>Eccentrick</hi> Orbe the Sun moves, as they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169801:80"/>ſay, according to the ſucceſſion of the twelve Signes from Weſt to Eaſt, not finiſhing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under three hundred ſixty five dayes, and about ſix houres. And withall as they aſſert, that by reaſon of this Orbe the Sun moves as in relation to the center of the earth, one while ſwifter, another while ſlower; that is to ſay, it moves ſlower whiles it is on the <hi>Northern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> part of the World, lingering there an hundred eighty ſix dayes, eight houres, and twelve mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuits; but runs ſwifter on the <hi>Southerne</hi> part of the World, diſpatching its race in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventy eight dayes, one and twenty hours, and twelve minuits; and ſo ſtayes longer with ſome of the Signes (as they ſay) and leſſe while with others. And that ſecondly, The Sun hath, as they ſay, a <hi>ſupreme</hi> Orbe contiguouſly adjoyned above to the aforeſayd Orbe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an <hi>inferiour</hi> Orbe, in like manner adjoyned beneath to the ſayd middle Orbe, both partly Concentrick, partly Eccentrick (the uſe of which two Orbs, as held forth by Aſtronomers, I ſhall not here ſtay to relate.) And the motion of thoſe two extreame. Orbs, is, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, very ſlow, ſo that they finiſh not their courſe, which is like ſome motion of the eighth Sphere, under forty nine thouſands of years (as <hi>Keckerman</hi> affirmes.) All which makes mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine demand, how any men could ever attaine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169801:81"/>to a certaine experience of Conjunctions of Starrs, ſeeing this number of forty nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand extends it ſelfe to an age above ſeven times older then the creation of the Starrs?</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious to recite all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Orbes and motions of all the other. Planets, according to the common opinion; as, that the <hi>Moone</hi> hath five Orbes, ſome of which move ſwifter then thoſe of the Sun, putting her twice every moneth in her <hi>Apoge</hi> or exaltation, and twice in her <hi>Perige</hi> or deſcention, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in both, that in the ſame <hi>Apoge</hi> it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times higher and ſometimes lower, and ſo in the ſame <hi>Perige;</hi> and hath one motion that is not finiſhed under eighteen yeares, ſeven moneths, and about twelve houres.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Saturne</hi> hath a motion whoſe courſe takes up thirty yeares; <hi>Jupiter</hi> one of twelve, <hi>Mars</hi> one of two, <hi>Venus</hi> of one. And <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies</hi> motion (as <hi>Keckerman</hi> affirmes) <hi>Eſt admodum varius imo magnâ parte adhuc incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus;</hi> that is, <hi>it is wonderfull various, yea for the moſt part yet unknowne.</hi> Now lay all theſe varieties and uncertainties together, and then judge what certainty of experience there can be had of the conjunctions of Starrs, juſt ſo long and ſo much, as to make ſuch a ſure impreſſion of ſuch influences and efficacies on men in the birth, as may duely and truely prognoſticate,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169801:81"/>that ſo ſhal ſuch a man be and doe; but ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thér, eſpecially in Twins.</p>
               <p>The third Argument. All rules of Sciences and Arts (by the fundamental Poſition of Artiſts) are <hi>Axiomes, Maxims, Theoremes, Canons. &amp;c.</hi> that is, Moſt worthy, and moſt ſpeciall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, experiments, or rules, for their verity and certainety. But ſuch are not the rules of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. Firſt, Becauſe of the foreſayd various va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and uncertainties of Starrs, both in their <hi>owne</hi> motions, and in compariſon with <hi>others.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe no man knoweth the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar qualities or efficacies of all the Starrs. No Artiſt yet ever undertooke to ſpeake of more then the ſeven <hi>Planets,</hi> and ſome few nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Fixed Starrs</hi> of ſome few ſeverall magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; leaving out millions that are neither named nor knowne. Yea thirdly, thouſands of Starrs cannot be ſo much as ſeen a minuit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as the Philoſophers confeſſe in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Via lactea,</hi> the <hi>Milky way</hi> in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, to be ſeen in a moſt ſtarry night, eſpecially in Winter. Fourthly, Becauſe all the Starrs doe ſhine upon the earth at once, joyntly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly; ſo that they that are under them cannot by any rule from nature know what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences ſhall be predominant in their effects. Fifthly, They have more time to alter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of young people from the Cradle to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169801:82"/>manhood carryed and walking abroad. I ſay to alter their complexion by radiation and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; then to ſtampe upon them an unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impreſſion upon them in the ſecret Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their birth; as we ſee many natural men and Women, not differenced by grace, much altered from Melancholly to Cheerfulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if ſome Starrs in one poſition, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at birth have a power to imprint; other Starrs, and perhaps more prevalent, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a power to blot out that in many yeares, and to inſtill a new one. Sixthly, There are many cauſes below between us and the Starrs to alter the influence of the Starrs, or interrupt their native operation; as the various complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the ayre, diverſity of windes, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent poſtures and ſituations of men, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under a direct, ſometimes under an oblique radation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seventhly, Aſtrologers depend on Clocks and Dyals, to know the poſture of the Heavens at the houre of their prognoſticating; which Dyals and Clocks oft are falſe, which may make a wide difference in a minuit, in which as we heard ſome motions of the Heavens run ſixty Miles. Eightly, The Aſtrologer cannot be able to allow exactly for the <hi>exaltation</hi> in the <hi>Apoge</hi> and <hi>deſcenſion</hi> in the <hi>Perige</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, with their ſwifter motion in the <hi>one</hi> then in the <hi>other,</hi> ſo as to determine juſtly how much
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169801:82"/>power of prevalence there may be in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences at ſuch changes. Ninthly, A man can never certainely conclude of a particular event from a cauſe that is moſt univerſal, moſt remote, and ſo but a partial cauſe of the thing predicted. But the Starrs are no other but ſuch a kinde of cauſe of mens complexions and actions; and therefore are no ſure grounds of prediction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the future afaires of men. The Parents complexion, Divine diſpenſations, occaſions, and opportunities among men, and a mans owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience to God, have farre more influence into man to diſpoſe him to be, or doe this or that, then all the myriads of Starrs. Tenthly, Aſtrology contending for ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Starrs over the ſoule of man (which is the principle of all actions) inferrs as if the ſoule of man were <hi>ex traduce,</hi> generated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Contrary to many Scriptures, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 102.18. <hi>The people that ſhall be Created ſhall praiſe the Lord. Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The spirit returnes to God that gave it, whiles the body returnes to the Earth. Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>We have had Fathers of our fleſh which corrected us, and we gave them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection unto the Father of Spirits?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Contrary to the <hi>rules of art,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and experience, <hi>Calum non agit in animam,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169801:83"/>&amp;c.</hi> The Heavens cannot act directly upon the ſoule; nor can a mans body complexionate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or maſter his naturall ſpirit. So that the <hi>To intelligere,</hi> and <hi>To Velle,</hi> the Acts of reaſon and wil doe not depend on ſenſe. For in ſleep, wee have ſtrong actings of reaſon: And when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, in the time of deepeſt rationall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſenſes are uſeleſſe, and their acts ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, as if we did neither ſee nor heare.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Argument againſt Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie that I ſhal urge, paſſing by innumerable others, is, That a maine part of the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and bottom on which <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> build the ſtructure of their Art of <hi>Prediction,</hi> is but meer imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for there is no ſuch thing as the tenth, or ninth Sphere: And therefore the <hi>Zodiack</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Aſtrologers in them, is but a dreamed fiction; yea and one of the <hi>Quondam</hi> great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers (M. P.)</hi> will dare to ſay, that the <q>
                     <hi>twelve Signes,</hi> bounded as they ſuppoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the demenſions of ſuch a thing as a <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack;</hi> namely, the Signes of <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &amp;c.</hi> that is, a <hi>Ramme,</hi> a <hi>Bull, &amp;c.</hi> (feigned to have power over the twelve parts of mans body) <hi>are onely twelve imaginary Signes: For in the</hi> HEAVENS (ſaith he) <hi>there is no ſuch matter as a Ram, a Bull, &amp;c.</hi> And how (ſaith he) can it ſtand with reaſon that in a firmament FEIGNED by Poets,</q> and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169801:83"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> a FORGED Signe (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is NOTHING) ſhould have any power, or operation in the bodies of men. Againe, the very order of Government of theſe ſignes in mans body, is <hi>fond</hi> and without <hi>ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> For according to this platforme, when the Moon commeth into the firſt Signe <hi>Aries,</hi> ſhee ruleth in the <hi>head;</hi> and when ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the ſecond Signe <hi>Taurus,</hi> ſhee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the <hi>neck;</hi> and ſo deſcends downe from part to part, ruling two, inſome three dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where obſerve (ſaith hee) that the Moon is made to rule in the <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moyſt parts,</hi> when ſhee is in the <hi>hot and dry Signes;</hi> whereas in reaſon, a more conſonant order were this, that when the Moon were-in <hi>hott and dry Signes,</hi> as in <hi>Aries, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Sagitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> ſhee ſhould rule in hott and dry parts of the body; and when ſhee is in <hi>cold and moyſt Signes,</hi> ſhe ſhould rule in the <hi>cold and moyſt parts of the body;</hi> and ſo ſtill governe thoſe parts which in temperature come neereſt to the Signes wherein the Moone is. Beſide this, ſome learned Phyſitians have upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience confeſſed, that THE OBSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION OF THE SIGNE IS NOTHING MATERIALL; and that there is no danger in it, for guelding of Cattell, or letting of blood. And the <hi>vanity</hi> of the old conceit and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169801:84"/>imagination of them that have put much in the Signes, appeares in the common practice of men, who commonly upon <hi>Stevens</hi> day uſe to let blood, be the Signe where it will. The truth is (ſaith he) the Signe in its owne nature is neither way available, being but a <hi>phantaſie,</hi> grounded upon <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> premiſes, and therefore ought to be rejected as meer VANITY. Thus farr he.</q>

               <p>Now let me add ſome particulars ſuiting to what he hath ſayd to illuſtrate the ſame; and ſo I ſhall not onely confirme him, but alſo what I affirmed my ſelfe in the beginning of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Touching thoſe <hi>feigned Firmaments,</hi> or Heavens, called the ninth and tenth Heavens; beſides that the ancient famous Aſtronomers, <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Hipparchus,</hi> and many others, knew no ſuch thing; ſenſe alſo doth evince that we can be ſure of no more but eight: For wee ſee diſtinctly the ſeven Planets, Sun, Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their ſeverall motions in twenty four hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we can perceive the eighth Heaven of fixed Starrs (knowne by their twinckling) to move in one motion, round the Earth in twenty foure houres; becauſe we can ſee the <hi>heeles</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Northerne Beare,</hi> adjacent to the North Pole, to be downward towards the Earth in the evening, and to be upward in the morning.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169801:84"/>But we have no ſure ground to conclude that there are more Heavens, either the <hi>Chryſtall ninth,</hi> or the <hi>firſt moving tenth.</hi> The grand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon brought to prove them from the two other motions of the eighth Heaven of fixed Starrs, beſide that from <hi>Eaſt to Weſt</hi> in twenty foure houres, as that the eighth Heaven of fixed Stars moves from Weſt to Eaſt, comming to be in the ſame poſture as when they began that motion, by the end of forty nine thouſand yeares. And that the ſame eighth Heaven hath another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>South to North, and thence to South againe,</hi> which proceſſe and receſſe is a finiſhing ſeven thouſand yeares; and therefore that that motion of the eighth Heaven, from <hi>Eaſt to Weſt</hi> in twenty foure houres, muſt needs be <hi>violent,</hi> as forced from ſome tenth Heaven, naturally ſo moving; and that from <hi>Weſt to Eaſt</hi> in forty nine thouſand yeares, muſt be alſo violent, as forced from ſome ninth Heaven, naturally ſo moving; and the laſt motion of the eighth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Viz. From South to North and back againe</hi> in ſeven thouſand yeares to be the <hi>naturall,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, innate motion of that eighth Heaven; ſeeing that (as they forme the Argument) one ſimple ſingle moveable body can have but one natural motion; I ſay this Argument doth not evince my reaſon in the leaſt, to beleeve the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and being of a ninth and tenth Heaven.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169801:85"/>For God that by his Word at the beginning ſayd to the Earth, <hi>Stand thou ſtill,</hi> and to the Sea, <hi>Move thou continually,</hi> with ſeverall motions, as of flowing and reflowing, twiſe every twenty foure houres, and they obey his voice to this day; the ſame God commanding the eighth Heaven to runn from <hi>Eaſt to Weſt</hi> every twenty foure houres; and withall to linger and ſlinck back every day a little from <hi>Weſt to Eaſt</hi> (as ſuppoſe with the Aſtronomer) as much as comes to one <hi>Degree,</hi> or ſixty miles in an hundred yeares (which is about three quarters of a mile in one yeare and halfe a quarter) and alſo to roule forward from <hi>South to North, and back againe from North to South,</hi> ſo gradually till in ſeven hundred yeares it is as it was, cannot chooſe but obey the voice of God; and ſo move without ceaſing. And (to throw away <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as well as in <hi>Divinity</hi>) tis a readier way and ſurer, to ſay God commanded the Heavens ſo to move at firſt creation, and they obey, then to ſay, <hi>Primus motor,</hi> God moves the <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Intelligences,</hi> they move a tenth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; a tenth heaven moves the other heavens. And to the clauſe of one natural body, we ſay that there is hardly any naturall motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome violent, as the <hi>Philoſopher cals violent.</hi> For if <hi>fire</hi> aſcends, no more of the flame aſcends in a pure natural motion, but that which aſcends
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169801:85"/>in the Mathematical indiviſible line in the point of the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> pointing from the center-point of the earth, to its correſpondent point in the Sphere of the loweſt Heaven. Indeed if the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramicall forme of the flame were turned upſide downe, then all the flakes of flame might ſeeme to take their natural order proportionable from one center-point in the Earth to their ſeverall correſpondent points in the Sphere of the loweſt Heaven.</p>
               <p>So of any heavy body, Stone, or Bowle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falling downe from ſome high places to the Earth, no more of it moves naturally, in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe notion of naturally, then the very middle of it tending downward in a Mathematicall ſtrait Line to the Center-point of the Earth; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſuch a Stone, or the circumference of that Bowle, falling not with the like naturall motion, becauſe there is but one univerſal Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-point in the middle of the Earth, to anſwer to all downward motions; which is the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call demonſtrative reaſon why naturally the Earth is round, the heavy parts more preſſing to the general Center-point, the lighter leſſer.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Water</hi> in its motion in a River, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tends downeward, yet deſires not to be ſo low as the Center of the Earth: And the meane while it tends progreſſively forward; and in this progreſſive motion, no more is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169801:86"/>naturall, but what proceeds in a ſtrait line: For the water hath no minde of it ſelfe to goe out of its Line; that being out of its way, and beſids its deſign. So that either we muſt ſay one body may have many naturall motions, or we muſt no more feigne more Heavens then eight, to move the reſt, in their ſeveral motions, then we dare feigne more Elements then foure, to manage the ſeverall motions that are in each one of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching <hi>the imaginarie</hi> Sphere the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> this muſt needs be an infalible conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo far as the <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>firmament</hi> of the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack</hi> is feigned, ſo farr of neceſſity muſt the <hi>Zodiack</hi> ſuppoſed in that Heaven or firmament be a meer feigned thing. (We heard afore, that moſt Learned Philoſopher and Aſtronomer <hi>Kec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerman</hi> lay it down for a ſure rule: That <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers</hi> may make, and uſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> that is, <hi>Suppoſitions,</hi> but <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> may not.) But the ninth and tenth Sphere or Heaven are feigned, therefore the <hi>Zodiack</hi> imagined in them is alſo feigned. Tis worth the while to heare <hi>Alſted</hi> (which is to our purpoſe) what he ſayth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> The Zodiack (ſaith he) of the firſt <hi>mover</hi> (that is the tenth Heaven) is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAGINARY, of the eighth Sphere real. The <hi>imaginary</hi> is <hi>Primaryly</hi> and ORIGINALLY in the firſt Mover, or tenth Heaven, in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169801:86"/>Spheres it is ſecondarily <hi>conceited.</hi> The Reall <hi>changeth</hi> its ſituation; the IMAGINARY doth note. The ſignes alſo of the real Zodiack, are wonderfull UNEQUAL, but in the <hi>imaginary</hi> equall. In <hi>accounts</hi> the imaginary Zodiack is more commodious; but not ſo in predictions. Thus you ſee how much <hi>fiction</hi> there is about the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> and more honour aſcribed to the <hi>feigned</hi> then to the <hi>reall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching the twelve imaginary Signes: There is no ſuch formes of Starrs, as of themſelves ſeeme ſuch. Compare <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Aries:</hi> And <hi>Aries</hi> lying under <hi>Balaena.</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Globes tell us ſuch things, but the Starrs of themſelves cold never make us ſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. See the Celeſtial Globe:</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Touching the diſorderly placing of the <hi>hott dry Signes</hi> in parts that are not hott and dry: Note that <hi>Alſted</hi> a Learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and was alſo an Aſtrologer (at leaſt in opinion) affirmes in his Syſtem, or Treatiſe of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> that the twelve Signes are divided into foure <hi>Trigonos,</hi> that is, <hi>Ternions,</hi> or <hi>Threes. In primo trigono ſunt ſigna ignea, videlicet,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES, LEO, <hi>&amp;</hi> SAGITTARIUS: <hi>In his dominatur Calor &amp; ſiccitas, quae dominantur cholerae. &amp; ſapori amaro:</hi> that is, <hi>In the firſt Ternion are the fiery Signes,</hi> ARIES <hi>the Ram,</hi> LEO <hi>the Lyon, and</hi> SAGITTARIUS, <hi>the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169801:87"/>In theſe Signes are predominant heat and dryneſſe, which have dominion and rule over Choler, and bitterneſſe.</hi> So <hi>Alſted, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ranoſc. Par.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Now that theſe Signes are thus aſſigned to have dominion; <hi>Aries</hi> on the <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> on the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> on the <hi>Reines and loynes;</hi> your Aſtrologers ſhew you in your ordinary and common <hi>Almanacks.</hi> But your Phyloſophers and Phyſitians will aſſure us upon ſtrong reaſon, that a man hath the <hi>Coldeſt braine,</hi> and <hi>moyſteſt heart,</hi> and <hi>humidſt reines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Touching the imagined Signes, and their ſuppoſed dominion over the parts of mans body, this would be taken into conſideration; that the <hi>Traditions</hi> about them is ſuch a fiction in the eyes of ſome <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> that ſome of them omit them, in their Almanacks, others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly deride them. So Maſter <hi>Pond</hi> in his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Should I but dare to omit the Anatomy,</l>
                  <l>Which long enough hath gul'd my Country friend.</l>
                  <l>He with contempt would ſtreight refuſe to buy</l>
                  <l>This Book; and tis no Almanack contend.</l>
                  <l>Aske him its uſe, hee'll ſay he cannot tell;</l>
                  <l>No more can I; yet ſince he love'ſt ſo well,</l>
                  <l>Ile let it ſtand becauſe my Book ſhall ſell.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And for my part, I have of purpoſe tryed the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169801:87"/>experiment of letting blood in that part where the Signe hath been (as the Almanacks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe) with very good ſucceſſe, and no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <head>SECTION V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Confuting the <hi>OBJECTIONS</hi> that are brought in the behalfe of <hi>ASTROLOGY.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I will not be ſo ſevere (unprovoked) as to take publick Cognizance of, and to name to the World, the Authors, Books, Predictions, or Practiſes that have apologized for, and acted in Aſtrologie; becauſe of other good Learning in them (which I reverence;) though in their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologicalls,</hi> I know they have exceedingly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If any wil be violently impertinent, <hi>Vijs &amp; modis,</hi> by all meanes to lay low others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or parts, thereby to advance their miſtakes, the <hi>Defendent</hi> then is bound to tell ALL THE TRUTH, which can be made good by ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall witneſſes, and teſtimony. That which I have in my eye to doe, is onely to give a light touch, and pointing with the finger upon ſome few <hi>things</hi> that are moſt ſpeciouſly pretended to be Patronages of Aſtrologie.</p>
               <p>And becauſe ſome are more <hi>Oratòrious,</hi> others more <hi>Logicall,</hi> I ſhal ſuit my language to theirs. And to the firſt I muſt ſay, it appeares by what
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169801:88"/>hath been ſayd in the precedent Treatiſe, that THE HEAVENS yet never ſpake the LAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUAGE of Aſtrology, ſo as the moſt learned in the World (aforenamed) cold ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And to rhetoricate high in the behalfe of <hi>Aſtronomie;</hi> or to kick downe low, them that ſlight it, is wide from the buſineſſe in hand touching <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> whoſe vaſt difference from the other was afore ſufficiently, though breifly, intimated: And though we ſhould owne it, that <hi>Pleyades, Arcturus, Orion,</hi> and <hi>other Starrs</hi> (mentioned in Scripture, and allowed therein to be lawfully mentioned by us) have ſtampt in them by creation a power of INFLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCES, whereby accordingly they OPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATE on ſublunary Bodies; men knowing in ſome meaſure thoſe influences, ſo that they lawfully PREDICT <hi>according to the knowne nature and quality</hi> of thoſe influences; yet will it not thence follow that there is any ſuch thing allowed as <hi>Judiciary Aſtrologie,</hi> to predict and foretell what ſhall befall men, and Cityes, and Common-wealths, in relation to <hi>humane</hi> affairs, <hi>arbitrary</hi> actings, and <hi>Spontaneous voluntary</hi> tranſactions that depend immediately upon the movings of the <hi>will</hi> of man. All that would naturally follow from thoſe <hi>indefinite</hi> premiſes (if granted) would be onely a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that therefore in ſome things men may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169801:88"/>be able in a lawfull way probably to predict ſome kinds of events, as what <hi>whether</hi> there ſhall be, or perhaps whether it will be an <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> or <hi>ſickly time</hi> for Men and Beaſtes, or ſuch like <hi>naturall</hi> effects of the naturall influences of ſtarrs. Which if men can atteine at times of the yeere to ſee <hi>diſtinctly</hi> in their juſt poſitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations, conjunctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the operations of their influences; they may perhaps ſometime blunder right, that ſo weather, health, or ſickneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as they conjectured. But all this, and if wee could name a 100. more <hi>naturall</hi> effects, would not ſatisfie the <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> or his Clients; nor keep up the reputation of the one, or anſwer the expectation of the other. They ordinarily come to the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> with theſe Queries? <q>Such a times was <hi>borne,</hi> after what manner ſhall <hi>my life and death be?</hi> Thither I intend to <hi>goe,</hi> and ſo and ſo to do, what ſhall be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe?</q> Such a night I was <hi>robbed,</hi> what <hi>manner of perſon</hi> was the Theife, and <hi>where, or how may</hi> I find him? Such a thing I loſt at ſuch a time, how may I <hi>get it againe?</hi> I am <hi>loved and do love</hi> ſeverall perſons in a way of marriage which may I take as <hi>lucky,</hi> which refuſe as <hi>unluckie?</hi> with infinite the like Queſtions, and many more ſtranger then theſe. To which if the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> make no anſwer, the Reſorters deſpiſe him. If
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169801:89"/>he doth undertake to give a poſitive anſwer to ſuch interogatories, then I muſt aske him what Scripture, or reaſon doth teach, or <hi>allow</hi> ſuch a kind of <hi>Aſtrologie?</hi> The Heathen <hi>Roman Senate</hi> (without direction from <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 18. whom they knew not, or acknowledged not) made laws againſt <hi>Vaticinatores;</hi> that is, <hi>Thoſe that would foretell things</hi> (<hi>as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> in his <hi>ſeventh</hi> Book, <hi>De Officio proconſulis,</hi> tells us) And if <hi>Gellius</hi> doth thinke that the common people underſtood by that name the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> (<hi>A. Gell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Noct. Att.</hi>) this doth not conclude that the learned <hi>Legiſlators</hi> ſo underſtood it. And if they did, the ſuſpition is yet unremoved, whether all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologicall Predictors</hi> of <hi>humane</hi> events and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> tranſactions are not of the ſame brann with the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Foretellers? And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> condemning A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie, condemne all without limitation, or diſtinction: ſo that wee have no warrant to take <hi>mans</hi> word againſt <hi>Gods</hi> word; but to refuſe their diſtinction of <hi>lawfull</hi> and unlawfull Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. For all <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> that is properly Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie in the opinion of Aſtrologers (and not <hi>Aſtronomie, Phyſiologie, or Meteorologie, &amp;c.</hi>) that is, to predict the effects aforeſayd, is <hi>vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſuperſtitious, falſe, abominable, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo are we to underſtand thoſe <hi>Epithites</hi> or aditional titles of Aſtrologie, in divine, and humane pious
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169801:89"/>Writers. For they do no more intimat a lawful <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology</hi> then in the common expreſſion, <hi>Turpe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, filthy or uncomly vice,</hi> doth intimat that any vice is not filthy but comly. So that Aſtrology was not hertofore before the time of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> &amp; <hi>An. Pius,</hi> unlawfull, onely becauſe then the Art was imperfect, and its prognoſtication <hi>uncertaine;</hi> but becauſe for many other and greater reaſons (as we heard afore) did God condemn it in his word the <hi>imperfection</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> alſo ſtill eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially adhering to it, as learned Aſtrological <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> but of the other day, and others more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; before mentioned ſufficiently. <hi>Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> they ſay, teacheth us, how neceſſary <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is.</hi> Could I have found it by peruſall of all his works, I ſhould have thought ſo too; but with the ſame labour finding the <hi>contrary,</hi> I muſt rather beleive what I <hi>ſee,</hi> then what I <hi>heare.</hi> He ſpeakes <hi>againſt Aſtrologie</hi> in his Commentary on <hi>Gen.

                  </q> is not onely an unwarrantable, but a moſt ſinfull, I had almoſt ſayd, a blaſphemous ſpeech. That God that can doe all things immediately of himſelfe (as we ſee in the Creation, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous operations) when he uſeth any of the Creatures in producing any effects, HE AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SISTETH THEM, not THEY HIM. And we finde not in the Scriptures that Hee uſed any Creatures to predict <hi>voluntary actions,</hi> but his <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that will defend <hi>Aſtrologicall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> by a diſtinction betweene <hi>Non illicitum,</hi> and <hi>Licitum,</hi> that though Aſtrologicall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not <hi>lawfull;</hi> yet they are <hi>not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,</hi> doe not conſider that <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull</hi> are immediate contraries; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cannot be truely aſſerted to be lawfull, is unlawfull: And as weake is their defence to preſume to ſay that Aſtrologicall predictions are no where in the Word of God forbidden; either explicitely or implicitely: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſuperficiall gloſſes (not worth a particular anſwer) on two or three Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are againſt them, whereby to abate their edge, and to ſave the head of Aſtrology from wounding; it hath heen abundantly afore demonſtrated out of many Scriptures, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169801:93"/>ſtrology, indefinitely, without exception is condemned by the Word of God. To whiffle off the dint of any Scripture, expreſly diſliking Aſtrology (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction that there <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Aſtrology is forbidden, not lawfull Aſtrology; hath been already anſwered; That all Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, properly ſo called, is condemned in the Word of God, by ſuch and the like <hi>Epithites,</hi> of <hi>ſuperſtitious, Heatheniſh, &amp;c.</hi> as all <hi>vice</hi> is condemned by the names of <hi>filthy, uncomely, (&amp;c.)</hi> vice. And thoſe termes added to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, of <hi>Superſtitious, Heatheniſh, &amp;c.</hi> are of the very dint of the Arguments in many places of Scripture, whereby the holy Ghoſt intends to render all Aſtrology odious.</p>
               <p>For the great matter that ſome would make of the <hi>mention of a Starr</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at Chriſts birth, &amp;c.</hi> whereby to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> I ſhall anſwer briefly (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Preſſe calls upon me to ſhut up.) Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we muſt conſider this Starr <hi>ſingly,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively:</hi> If <hi>ſingly,</hi> then if this was a <hi>reall</hi> Starr, it was either <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary:</hi> If <hi>ordinary,</hi> namely, made and ſettled in its <hi>being</hi> in the firſt creation, and ever ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>appearance,</hi> how ſhould it of its ſelfe ſignifie Chriſts birth an effect, once onely to be, from the beginning to the end of the World?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169801:93"/>It is unpoſſible that a common cauſe, or ſigne, of it ſelfe can be a ſure demonſtration of a new ſingle ſingular effect, never to be but once. If it was an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Starr, then either ſo in being <hi>newly created;</hi> which inferrs that God did not create all <hi>things</hi> in the beginning, no not all <hi>kindes</hi> of things; for the <hi>Starrs,</hi> ſay the Philoſophers upon the ground of their different natures, do <hi>Differre ſpecie,</hi> differ in kind. If extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary only in <hi>appearance,</hi> now, and not afore appearing, how ſhould it of it ſelfe teach any Aſtrologer the ſayd event, who mainly pretends experience? If it were a <hi>ſeeming</hi> ſtarr; that is, a <hi>Comet,</hi> or Blazing ſtarr: Firſt, that rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſageth death, then birth, by reaſon of the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and filthy fumes and exhalations of which it is compounded, and being on fire diffuſeth them into the ayer in which the Sons of men are enwrapped. Secondly, Then, this ſtarr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs rather to <hi>Metereologie</hi> (a part of naturall Philoſophie) then to Aſtrologie. If we conſider this ſtarr <hi>conjunctively;</hi> namely, together with propheticall explanations upon it (as the ſtarres in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.) then the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſtarre was more <hi>Theologicall</hi> then <hi>Aſtrologicall.</hi> And this is ſuppoſed by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both ancient and moderne, that the wiſe men of the Eaſt tooke into conſideration the ſignification of this ſtarre by the help of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>

                  <hi>Calcidius</hi> likewiſe a <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſopher flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the time of Chriſts birth, writing upon <hi>Plato</hi> his <hi>Timeus,</hi> concerning diverſe Starrs and their wonderful effects, ſaith thus, <hi>there is a more</hi>

               <p>Next wee will give a ſhort reply to them that are more <hi>Logicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> God made the ſtarres to be <hi>ſignes, Gen.</hi> 1. 14. therefore the knowledge of the ſignification of thoſe ſignes is lawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God made them to be ſignes of naturall effects or events; not of <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>morall,</hi> that depend on mans will, on which the Starrs have no power: <hi>Corpus non agit in animam.</hi> A body cannot act upon the ſpirit of a man, no more then a materiall Sword can wound an Angell. Againe the Starres are not ſignes to us of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall events, as to wit, not of naturall <hi>contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> (to us contingent) as the lighting of a Crow neere us, or, &amp;c. but of naturall <hi>neceſſaries</hi> knowne by apparent common experience. As that of <hi>Solomon;</hi> when they cauſe a <hi>north wind; it drives away raine, &amp;c.</hi> And that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. ſpeaking according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience men had. <hi>When the ſkie is red in the evening, ye ſay it will be faire weather. But when the ſkie is red and lowring in the morning, it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169801:96"/>will be foule weather.</hi> Further, The Starres may be ſignes in regard of their <hi>motions,</hi> belonging meerly to pure <hi>Aſtronomie,</hi> as when there wil be an ecclipſe; though they ſhould never be ſigns of any events in regard of their influences or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The Starres are cauſes of many things here below. But it cannot be unlawfull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve cauſes how they produce their effects, <hi>Scire eſt per cauſas ſcire.</hi> All true knowledge is by the cauſes. And <hi>therefore, Felix qui poterit rerum eognoſcere cauſas,</hi> he is happy that knows the <hi>cauſes of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Wee ſayd but now, the motions of the Starrs <hi>cauſe</hi> ecclipſes; ſomtimes of the Moon by the interpoſition of the earth exactly between it and the Sun; ſomtimes of the Sun by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect interpoſition of the Moone between us and the body of the Sunne, which the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer</hi> (though he never knew the leaſt of the inward influentiall qualities of any of the Stars) can predict. And therefore all this doth add nothing at all to countenance <hi>Aſtrologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee demand what cauſes are the Starres? Not particular cauſes of particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, but generall common cauſes that work in common, and alike upon all things. Now no man can divine of a <hi>particular event</hi> by a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe,</hi> unleſſe he know the particular cauſes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169801:96"/>ſubordinate and their particular vertues. Some give this inſtance, that a man cannot, by ſetting many <hi>ſorts</hi> of egges under a Hen, foretell what will be hatcht, by the meer ſitting of the Hen in common upon them all; unleſſe, alſo he know the particular qualityes of thoſe egges; ſo from the Starres, being common cauſes no man can foretell events, unleſſe he knew the kinds and qualities of cauſes and things ſubordinate to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Experience ſhews that <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hit right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this <hi>Maſter Perkins,</hi> and other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Learned men, and with appeale to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of thoſe of as great antiquity as the times of the Apoſtles; gives this anſwer, and with great confidence; that in this there is <q>a <hi>ſecret Magick</hi> at leaſt; if not an <hi>open cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with the Devill; he making ſupply what is wanting in the vertue of Starres, and rules of <hi>Aſtrologie.</hi> And, ſay they, this is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that have known this Art. So farre they.</q> Conſonant to which wee referr the Reader to what before was confeſt by <hi>Maſtor Brigges, Saint Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> he makes mention of. Which is the more confirmed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> client comes <hi>tempting</hi> him and not <hi>confiding</hi> in him; that is, in his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169801:97"/>skill, he can do nothing, but if he can admire the Artiſt, and rely upon his skill, then he can anſwer his deſires. And this is confeſt by them that have been great <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> but now repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting have left it, whom if need be, I can name</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were greatly skild in this Art. For of <hi>Moſes</hi> tis ſayd, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. That <hi>he was learned in all the</hi> WISDOME OF THE EGYPLIANS. And of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 1.17.20. <hi>That he had ſkill in all Learning and wiſdome of the</hi> CHALDAEANS.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If they had practiſed it in their younger yeeres, it doth neither follow nor appeare in the Bible, that they continued to practiſe it. For wee are ſure at mans eſtate they were precious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. Secondly, It is ſayd, they had <hi>ſkill,</hi> not, that they <hi>practiſed</hi> it. They might have skill, and to uſe it as <hi>Saint Auſtin, Maſter Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Maſter Brigges, &amp;c.</hi> to abhor and teſtifie againſt the evill of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. It is plaine that <hi>Moſes</hi> was oppoſite to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and by his ſkill conquered and ſhamed them, and convinced them, that the <hi>finger of God was in what Moſes did.</hi> And of <hi>Daniel</hi> it is ſaid, that he was in ſkill <hi>ten times</hi> BETTER <hi>then all the Aſtrologers or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169801:97"/>Magicians that were in all Nebuchadnezzars Realme, Dan.</hi> 1.20. Therefore his skill muſt needs be divine, and above <hi>Aſtrologie.</hi>

Yet men doe uſe for trying of the Mathematicians skil, to bring them the figures of the births of beaſts, which they have for this end diligently obſerved at home; and him they hold the moſt skilfull Mathematician that can ſay by the figure, this portendeth the birth of a beaſt, and not of a man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

They will pretend to ſpeake truthes, yet forſake the Word dictated by the ſpirit; which is the <hi>rule</hi> of truth: Or elſe how ſhal it be diſcerned whether any ſpeake <hi>lyes,</hi> as tis in this Text; for other men that ſpeake contrary to them may as wel pretend the ſpirit and to ſpeake truth, as wel as they; unleſſe they wil ſay all men ſpeak truth. And then they advance all men to be as high ſpiritually as they pretend themſelves to be, and ſo overthrow all their owne glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is there Propheſied, that their <hi>conſciences are ſeared with an hot Iron;</hi> that is, they are hardened, and ſtupified, as a part of a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169801:104"/>mans fleſh is when ſeared. And that a mad kind of profeſſors of this Age have attained to this ſin and miſery alſo, is cleere by that mine and others eares have heard from their own mouths, profeſſing that they <hi>were wont to be troubled for every thing, every ſmall ſin, but now troubled at nothing, counting it their perfection.</hi> And have called exhortations to walke by the rules of the Goſpel, <hi>Legalities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Forbidding to marry;</hi> which none more doe in effect then the <hi>Ranters, Adamites, &amp;c.</hi> of theſe times. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe by <hi>retaile,</hi> forbidding ſome <hi>men,</hi> as their <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at <hi>ſome time; Viz. In Lent, &amp;c.</hi> But the madd Profeſſors of theſe times, by <hi>whole ſale,</hi> thinking and practiſing that <hi>Women are common;</hi> they ſay, <hi>They are free, their spirits are free;</hi> namely to make their fleſh common: And ſay, <hi>that though they goe away and lye with others Husbands or Wives, yet they know no Man or Woman after the fleſh:</hi> Witneſſe ſome of their Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Commanding to abſtaine from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of them which beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> Thus doe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of theſe laſt times, <hi>forbid certaine meats</hi> at ſome times; thus doe the <hi>Jewiſh Chriſtians</hi> of theſe dayes; if not the <hi>Diggers</hi> too, forbidd ſome meats at all times: And our late <hi>wilde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:169801:105"/>of ſeverall Sects,</hi> are againſt <hi>receiving meats with thanksgiving;</hi> againſt praying or praiſing for their meat at Meales.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Tis propheſied in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. That in the laſt dayes, <hi>men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, &amp;c.</hi> What men? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Men that are a kinde of Profeſſors: For ſo is the cloſe to all theſe vices, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Having a forme of godlineſſe, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power.</hi> The like of <hi>ſelfe-love</hi> was never ſeen, as in theſe dayes among men named Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: Every man minding himſelfe, ſhifting for himſelfe, prejudicing his neighbour, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and reputation; all is his owne that any man can get, though with betraying others: and their religious diſcourſe is to calumniate, and condemne others unheard.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In the ſame, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. Tis prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, men ſhal be <hi>covetous.</hi> So likewiſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. This unhappy Age doth too much verifie this; and anſwer to the propheſie thereof, in that there have and doe now abound, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unrighteous <hi>Plunderers</hi> of private mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but alſo <hi>Sycophants,</hi> State-cozeners, Cheaters of the Common-wealth, unfaithfull in their Accounts; beſides <hi>Bribe-takers,</hi> that ſel Juſtice, if not injuſtice for Money.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Tis propheſied there, and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. that men ſhall be <hi>Boaſters, proud, blaſphemers,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169801:105"/>heady, high-minded:</hi> Of ſuch this preſent evill Age ſwarmes. Out of <hi>pride</hi> they <hi>boaſt</hi> and that <hi>blaſphemouſly,</hi> that <hi>they are God</hi> (in expreſſe termes) aſſuming to themſelves the <hi>titles, and authoritative formes of ſpeech of God himſelfe:</hi> Of old, <hi>Adam</hi> would be <hi>as</hi> God, the <hi>Angells</hi> would be <hi>as</hi> God; the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> would be a <hi>kinde</hi> of God; but theſe ſay, <hi>They are the great God;</hi> and that the <hi>creature is God,</hi> and <hi>God is the creature;</hi> but with <hi>Oathes and blaſphemies vilifie the true God,</hi> as mine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eares can teſtifie: And to ſeale up their iniquities; what theſe <hi>high-minded, Super-luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian</hi> proud ſpirits, doe as with the tongues of Devils belch out, they doe as <hi>headily</hi> ſtand in, being paſt all conviction, by way of Argument, but in ſtead thereof, as waters ſtopt, they ſwell up the more, and run over, beating downe all bancks and bounds of common civility, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Tis propheſied in the ſame ſecond Verſe, that men ſhal be <hi>diſobedient to Parents: Parents</hi> in the <hi>fift Commandement</hi> ſignifie all <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</hi> Sutably <hi>Peter</hi> propheſies of the ſame times, and the ſame kinde of men, 2 <hi>Ep. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>V.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgement to be puniſhed, but chiefly them that walke after the fleſh, in the luſt of uncleanneſſe, and deſpiſe government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169801:106"/>preſumptuous and ſelfe-will'd, they are not afrayd to ſpeak evill of Dignities; whereas the Angels greater in power durſt not. Jude, Verſ.</hi> 8, 9. Hath the ſame expreſſion, and the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should ſeeme this ſin of <hi>deſpiſing Superiours</hi> is a moſt damnable ſin, and rife in thoſe that <hi>walke after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſſe:</hi> No wonder, becauſe <hi>Dignities and Superiours, Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> inſtruct againſt, and ſtrike againſt ſuch their vices. And by woefull experience I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe know that this evill Age abounds with ſuch; namely, with <hi>State-Levellers,</hi> and <hi>Church-Levellers:</hi> the former pulling downe civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (though the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) ſtriving to bring Government downe to a <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, parity,</hi> if not, <hi>Anarchie.</hi> Some of them profeſſing againſt <hi>Civill ſalutations of any man,</hi> by putting off of Hatts, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that they know no relations, but of <hi>Fellow-creatures.</hi> And if the Scriptures be urged againſt them, they (if they deny them not) turne all into Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, formed by their owne phantaſies. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Church-Levellers,</hi> oppoſing the Offices in the Miniſtry, of <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Teacher:</hi> and by a pretence of <hi>Propheſying,</hi> which they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell what it was in the <hi>Eſſentiall definition,</hi> they equally intereſt many talkative, but unfit Brethren unto the right or liberty of <hi>Teaching;</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:169801:106"/>and if they may <hi>teach</hi> (ſay they) they may alſo <hi>adminiſter the Seales:</hi> Eſpecially if (as ſome <q>of them hold) there be no inſtituted ſolemne forme of adminiſtration, eſpecially of the Communion: Onely the Elements to be put before them, and every one to take them.</q> We ſpeake what we know to our ſorrow, or elſe we ſhould not ſpeake it.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Tis propheſied, <hi>Viz.</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. That in the laſt dayes men <hi>ſhall be unthankefull:</hi> This is proper to theſe dayes, wherein men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all ranks have been moſt ungratefull to them of whom they have received moſt favours. 'Twas a great ſpeech among the <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſay, <hi>Giftleſſe gifts;</hi> but we can ſay farr more in theſe dayes; namely, <hi>Hate-procuring gifts:</hi> Men that have been kinde to others, have procured nothing at laſt, but hate for their love; a ſorry exchange.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy:</hi> This naturally followes the other, <hi>Ingratum dixeris, &amp; omnia dixeris;</hi> ſay a man's <hi>ingratefull and ſay he is any thing:</hi> And this is the idiom of all falſe ſorts and ſects of Profeſſors, and the ſure ſymptome that they are naught, in that they are <hi>unholy,</hi> impure, of a filthy converſe and converſation, turning li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty into licentiouſneſſe: Their <hi>Principles,</hi> their <hi>language,</hi> their <hi>practiſe</hi> unholy. And they are not unholy onely with <hi>hypocriticall</hi> unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169801:107"/>but with <hi>prophane</hi> unholineſſe, of aothes, blaſphemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (uſing the forme of words of the Communion, in their toſſings of their Wine-cups) with <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> unholineſſe, and worſe, tranſgreſſing all rules of civility; and laſtly, with <hi>Atheiſticall</hi> unholineſſe, which is worſe then Diabolicall (the Devill being no Atheiſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.) For whiles they ſay, <hi>God is all things,</hi> and all the Creatures are God (as they did 312. years after Chriſt, as appeares largely in <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>) they indeed <hi>make God as nothing.</hi> So that the Apoſtle puts this <hi>unholineſſe</hi> as a thing like the belly of the <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> or a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,</hi> containing all vices.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Tis propheſied, namely in that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3, 4. That in the laſt dayes men ſhall be without <hi>naturall affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, and Traytors.</hi> Theſe are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally put together, vices are chained. Theſe in ſpeciall; and faſtened upon the myriades of Mal-profeſſors, the falſe Chriſtians of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Age: They doe, or have aſſumed the name of Profeſſors, or Chriſtians, but now being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent,</hi> not abſtaining, almoſt from any vice; and being fierce in their evil, they have <hi>loſt all naturall affection to their owne Kinne and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> breaking all <hi>truces and compacts;</hi> brother <hi>betraying</hi> brother, the Son the Father, and many
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169801:107"/>betraying their owne truſt, and ſo the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſtates of others, and ofttimes their lives too; and on the contrary, <hi>hating all that are good; Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi> againſt <hi>true Profeſſors;</hi> as theſe late Warrs have abundantly verified.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Lovers of pleaſures more then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God;</hi> which is the complexion of falſe Profeſſors in theſe dayes; whoſe judgement and practice tend to <hi>wantonneſſe,</hi> ſetting aſide the love of God, as a feigned notion, making God indeed, to be nothing; affirming moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, that <hi>their reaſon is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, In <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Creep into Houſes, leading captive ſilly Women, laden with ſins, led away with diverſe luſts:</hi> This moſt ſadly ſuites to theſe pernicious times, as appeares by thoſe <hi>Ranting</hi> Prieſts, or Teachers, who in private <hi>Preach and practice Doctrines of Adulteries,</hi> and running away with other mens Wives.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, In <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Reſiſting the truth as Jannes and Jambres did Moſes:</hi> Juſt ſo now, ſwarmes of thoſe that are unſound in the truth, make it their whole buſineſſe to bring the <hi>ſound conſcionable Miniſters of Chriſt into contempt,</hi> accounting it a great peice of Religion ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, Tis propheſied in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>There ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169801:108"/>ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord that bought them:</hi> Which is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fulfilled in theſe times; wherein thoſe that take upon them the notion of <hi>Teachers,</hi> and their followers (not to mention their innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable other Hereſies) have affirmed, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>is a carnall or fleſhly thing: That thoſe that are growne Chriſtians may goe to God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately without a Chriſt.</hi> Others goe higher; that <hi>Chriſt did not riſe againe.</hi> Others yet higher; <hi>Contemning him by the notion of the man dying at Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </q> Thus firſt in their <hi>blaſphemous opinions,</hi> they <hi>deny the Lord Chriſt that bought them;</hi> that bought them, not onely in the <hi>judgement of Charity,</hi> which is not the ful weight of the Apoſtles aggravation of their ſin; but alſo bought them, in <hi>laying downe a ſufficient price for all ſinners,</hi> and ſo for them; yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bought them <hi>in taking upon him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature of all men,</hi> bringing it neerer to him then the nature of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. whereby he makes mankinde <hi>ſaveable</hi> (denying it to lapſed Angels.) Yea laſtly, bought them, <hi>in preaching to them in the Goſpel that he dyed for ſinners inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, offering himſelfe and ſalvation by his blood unto them, beſeeching them to receive him</hi> by faith, and he will <hi>actually ſave them.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They deny him in their <hi>impious practiſes,</hi> (called <hi>A trampling of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 10.29.)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169801:108"/>For <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. Tis here ſayd, <hi>Through covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they make merchandiſe of you.

Are gon aſtray from the right way unto the way of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Wells without water, and Clouds car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with a tempeſt,</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>Speaking great ſwelling words of vanity, they allure through the luſts of the fleſh, through much wantonneſſe thoſe that were eſcaped from them who live in errour,</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>Who promiſing them liberty, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the ſervants of corruption.</hi> Verſ. 20. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the World,</hi> THROUGH THE KNOVVLEDGE OF THE LORD AND SAVIOUR IESUS CHRIST, <hi>they are againe intangled therein and overcome, the later end is worſe with them then the beginning.</hi> O what a lively Iconiſme and Character is this of theſe times; limbing forth to the life, the hereticall impious perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that deny Chriſt in practiſe alſo. Evill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will not be alone, without evill practiſes. If men <hi>teach</hi> errours and hereſies it muſt <hi>be for ſome advantage.</hi> They doe as in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>through covetouſneſſe make merchandiſe of their auditory.</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:169801:109"/>Their hearts being <hi>exerciſed,</hi> as tis in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Verſe, with covetous practiſes,</hi> they vent wicked ſtrange Doctrines, and thereby as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. receive of their followers the <hi>wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, as Balaam</hi> did of <hi>Balaak</hi> for comming to curſe and ſeduce the people of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> So they <hi>make merchandiſe of Profeſſors;</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their ſoules to ſin and Hell, for the gaine they receive by teaching ſuch Doctrines: And on the other ſide, if <hi>people will maintaine ſuch Impoſtors,</hi> for teaching ſuch their Doctrines, there muſt be ſomething in thoſe Doctrines <hi>that muſt exceedingly pleaſe that people.</hi> Now the two ingredients mentioned in this Chapter, and Preached in this Age by theſe Varlets, pleaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearted Profeſſors exceeding wel; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Doctrines of <hi>adultery,</hi> of <hi>luſts of the fleſh,</hi> and of <hi>much wantonneſſe;</hi> and Doctrines of <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> that <hi>there is no need of a Chriſt, no need to labour or trouble themſelves with faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the rules of the Goſpell.</hi> Though they were once carryed on in a way of <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in and through the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> yet now they may <hi>lay aſide Chriſt,</hi> and tis their LIBERTY ſo to doe; and their <hi>corruption of practice is their perfection,</hi> as they openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it in theſe evill dayes; and though in the judgement of the Scriptures and of good men, they are as BRUTE BEASTS, and SPOTS,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169801:109"/>and BLEMISHES to the beauty of the Church; yet they <hi>count it pleaſure to ryot, in the day time of the Goſpel,</hi> and if need be of the <hi>naturall day;</hi> and <hi>ſporting</hi> themſelves in their laſcivious ways, though good men count them <hi>deceivings.</hi> But that, nor our eares, nor this place wil beare it, many horrid particulars might be here recited, of the practiſes of theſe times. <hi>They ſpeak great ſwellings</hi> (but are but) WORDS, and of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> Though they ſeeme to be <hi>Wells,</hi> yet not to <hi>hold the waters of life,</hi> Doctrines of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but onely pitts to catch mens ſoules in. And though they ſeem to be <hi>high,</hi> they are but <hi>Clouds,</hi> and not ſet to raine and drop downe the Doctrines of truth; but empty Clouds <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed up and downe with the tempeſts of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of motions of their luſts, and admiration of a freſh auditory, to adore them for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and fleſh-pleaſing Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, Tis propheſied in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>That in the laſt dayes there ſhall be Scoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their owne luſts, and ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his comming, for ſince the Fathers fell aſleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation?</hi> Moſt exactly fulfilled in theſe dayes; thouſands of people alleadging the Scriptures (as theſe doe) for their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, but refuſe them where they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. They ſettle themſelves in a way of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169801:110"/>
               <hi>walking after their owne luſts,</hi> and then turne <hi>Scoffers and deſpiſers of the Doctrine of Heaven and Hell, and the immortality of the ſoule;</hi> as mine, and others eares in part can witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Seventeethly, and laſtly, Tis propheſied in <hi>Jude, Verſ.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>That thoſe ſcoffers in the laſt times, walking after their owne ungodly luſts, ſhould ſeparate themſelves, but are ſenſuall, not having the ſpirit.</hi> A moſt high impudence; yet fulfilled in theſe times upon many. Theſe ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers openly making local Heaven and Hell, and the reunion of ſoule and body after death, a meer fiction; they utterly make voyd the whole frame and Syſtem of the Scriptures, wherein we are taught <hi>the ſpirit, and doe receive the ſpirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and yet wil pretend the ſpirit. They are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, meer <hi>vegetable, or animals,</hi> in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſpirit of grace; yea, live moſt <hi>ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and contrarily <hi>to the operation of the ſpirit where it dwels,</hi> and yet pretend to have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. They <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they ſeparate, ſegregate, or put a notion of diſtinction on themſelves in their owne opinion, that they have the ſpirit; that they are better then others that are more ſtrict, and yet the Apoſtle wil allow them to be but <hi>animals</hi> at the beſt; yea <hi>Bruit beaſts,</hi> as yee heard, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. as their lives teſtifie againſt them, in that they walke after their owne luſts, and not after the rules and ruleings of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169801:110"/>ſpirit, as it acts in them that have indeed the holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Thus yee have a ſhort ſurvey of the mighty maſſe of evils of the laſt dayes; yee have had alſo a parallel of thoſe ſinnes, and theſe preſent times we now live in. And not onely here in theſe Nations we live in, but of other Nations beyond the Seas, eſpecially where peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty have abounded after great troubles. Their rotten hearted men, their helliſh Books, and Writings, and ſo their damnable opinions and wayes of practice, have been tranſmitted hither, ſo that the whole Earth, the whole Chriſtian World is corrupted before the Lord.</p>
            <p>What therefore can we expect, but that the Lord ſhould take up ſome ſuch reſolutions as he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. immediately afore the Flood; to bring an univerſal deſtruction or deſolation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generality of them that are called Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors or Chriſtians, called there the <hi>Sons</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>And ſurely (a thing to be trembled at) God hath not been ſilent to tel as wel what ſhal be the <hi>judgement</hi> upon the ſins of the laſt times; as the <hi>ſins</hi> of the laſt times: And therefore if the <hi>ſins</hi> of the laſt times be ours, the <hi>judgements</hi> of the laſt times wil be ours, unleſſe ſome effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courſe be taken: For Gods threatnings are conditional in the meaning, however expreſſed, as we ſee in the ſtory of <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="206" facs="tcp:169801:111"/>
            <p>Though <hi>judgements</hi> are threatned in the ſame places of Scripture where we had the <hi>ſins</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheſied. (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.

            <p>You ſee then it ſhal not be in vaine for the little flock of the godly to humble and pray, when an univerſal ſtorme is comming.
